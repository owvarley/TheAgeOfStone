RESTRICTIONS


1: 	Under NO circumstances is this code, or the names "Wheel of Time" 
	"Robert Jordan", or "WoT" to be used for profit of any sort.  The
	Name "Wheel of Time" and all related world data associated with
	this name are copyright Robert Jordan and TOR Books, who have
	granted Muds in general a limited license to use these names with
	the stipulations that no money changes hands and proper credits
	are given their due.

2:	You must follow all guidelines in the following licenses;
	Docs/license.txt Docs/Rom/license.rom Docs/Diku/license.diku
	Docs/Diku/license.merc

3:	The login message to your mud must contain the following
	statement.

	 based on
        WoT Mud v1.0, copyright (c) 1998, 2000 by Gary McNickle
        ROM Mud v2.4 beta, copyright (c) 1993, 1996 by Russ Taylor.


     example:

		Welcome to "Your Mud Name Here", v1.0

                                 based on
          WoT Mud v1.0, copyright (c) 1998, 2000 by Gary McNickle
        ROM Mud v2.4 beta, copyright (c) 1993, 1996 by Russ Taylor.


	The above statement must be placed in the login screen (The screen
	seen by a player when they first connect) in such a manner as to
	be readable by both new and old characters on a 24-line terminal
	with no scroll-back or color.  This means you cannot put these 
	credits on the top of a 24+ line ascii graphic, as this would 
	cause the credits to scroll off the screen.  Final decision 
	on compliance/non-compliance with this requirement is left solely 
	to the judgement of the developers of the WoT and ROM Mud systems.

4:	The help files must include entries for Diku, Merc, ROM and WoT
	Muds, readable by all players, and unaltered from the file 
	included with the source code, except as authorized by the
	prospective Mud system authors.

5:	Before opening a WoT based mud, you must send email to the author
	(gary@tarmongaidon.org), so that I can keep track of sites for future
    code releases and verify copyright compliance.
