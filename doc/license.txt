In compiling this code, you have agreed to the following restrictions on
any operating version of WoT code:

1: 	Under NO circumstances is this code, or the names "Wheel of Time" 
	"Robert Jordan", or "WoT" to be used for profit of any sort.  The
	Name "Wheel of Time" and all related world data associated with
	this name are copyright Robert Jordan and TOR Books, who have
	granted Muds in general a limited license to use these names with
	the stipulations that no money changes hands and proper credits
	are given their due.

2:	You must follow all guidelines in the following licenses;
        WoT (license.wot) ROM (rom.license) diku (license.doc), Merc
        (license.txt)

3:	The login message to your mud must contain the following
	statement.

 		 		   based on
		WoT Mud v0.1b, copyright 1998-2000, Gary McNickle
	       ROM Mud v2.4 beta, copyright 1993-1996, Russ Taylor.


       example:

				Welcome to
		          Your Mud Name Here, v1.0

                                 based on
              WoT Mud v0.1b, copyright 1998-2000, Gary McNickle
             ROM Mud v2.4 beta, copyright 1993-1996, Russ Taylor.


	The above statement must be placed in the login screen (The screen
	seen by a player when they first connect) in such a manner as to
	be readable by both new and old characters on a 24-line terminal
	with no scroll-back.  This means you cannot put these credits on
	the top of a 24=line ascii graphic, as this wouid cause the
	credits to scroll off the screen.  Final decision on compliance/
        non-compliance with this requirement is left solely to the
	judgement of the developers of the WoT and ROM Mud systems.

4:	The help files must include entries for Diku, Merc, ROM and WoT
	Muds, readable by all players, and unaltered from the file
	included with the source code, except as authorized by the
	prospective Mud system authors.

5:	Before opening a WoT based mud, you must send email to the author
	(gary@tarmongaidon.org), so that I can keep track of sites for future
        code releases.

6:	Any use of the term "Wheel of Time" is copyright Robert Jordan and
	remains the exclusive rights of same.  Any use of the term "WoT"
	is copyright Gary McNickle and Dark Harvest Systems and remains
	their exlusive property.  This means you may not use either of
	these terms as names for your MUD without the express permission
	of the aforementioned parties.

7:	As a coder, you have full rights to release your own derivatives 
	of the WoT code, provided they follow the restrictions of this
	license, contain all appropriate README and credits files, and are
   	properly labelled as being derivatives of the WoT v1.0 code (just
	as WoT is itself a derivative of ROM 2.4 beta code).  

7:	Anyone not wishing to follow terms of the WoT license shall be
	obligated to delete all copies of this code in their possession.
	This includes, but is not limited to, failure to display full 
	credits for WoT, ROM, Merc, and Diku.

If you have any questions about this license, please send email to
gary@tarmongaidon.org.
