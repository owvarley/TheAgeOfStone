  Master of the lightnings, rider on the storm,
  wearer of a crown of swords, spinner-out of fate.
  Who thinks he turns the Wheel of Time,
  may learn the truth too late.

  --from a fragmentary translation of "The Prophecies
    of the Dragon", attributed to Lord Mangore Kiramin,
    Sword-bard of Aramaelle and Warder to
    Caraighan Maconar, into what was then called
    the vulgar tongue (circa 300 AB).
