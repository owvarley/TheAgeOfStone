  With his coming are the dread fires born again. The
hills burn and the land turns sere.  The tides of men run
out, and the hours dwindle.  The wall is pierced, and the
veil of parting raised.  Storms rumble beyond the horizon,
and the fires of heaven purge the earth.  There is no
salvation without destruction, no hope this side of death.
