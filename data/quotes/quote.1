  And it shall come to pass that what men made shall be shattered,
and the Shadow shall lie across the Pattern of the Age, and the Dark One
shall once more lay his hand upon the world of man.  Women shall weep and
men quail as the nations of the earth are rent like rotting cloth.
Neither shal anything stand nor abide...
  Yet one shall be born to face the Shadow, born once more as he was born
before and shall be born again, time without end.  The Dragon shall be
Reborn, and their shall be wailing and gnashing of teeth at his rebirth.
In sackcloth and ashes shall he clothe the people, and he shall break the
world again by his coming, tearing apart all ties that bind.  Like the
unfettered dawn shall he blind us, and burn us, yet shall the Dragon
Reborn confront the Shadow at the Last Battle, and his blood shall give us
the Light.  Let tears flow, O ye people of the world.  Weep for your
salvation.
