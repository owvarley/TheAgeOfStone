    There can be no health in us, nor any good thing grow,
for the land is one with the Dragon Reborn, and he one
with the land.  Soul of fire, heart of stone, in pride he
conquers, forcing the proud to yield.  He calls upon the 
mountains to kneel, and the seas to give way, and the very
skies to bow.  Pray that the heart of stone remembers tears,
and the soul of fire, love.

  --From a much disputed translation of
  "The Prophecies of the Dragon" by the poet
  Kyera Termendal, of Shiota, believed to have
  been published between FY 700 and FY 800
