   "No, lad, it no be the treasure that makes for seeing the world. If you
 find youself a fistful of gold, or some dead kings jewels, all well
 and good, but it be the strangeness you see that pulls you to the next
 horizon. In Tanchico--that be a port on the Aryth Ocean--part of the
 Panarchs Palace were built in the Age of Legends, so it be said._
 There be a wall there with a frieze showing animals no man living has
 ever seen,"

   "The breaking left a thousands wonders behind, and there been half a dozen
 empires or more since, some rivaling Artur Hawkwings, everyone leaving
 things to see and find. Lightsticks and razorlace and heartstone. A
 crystal lattice lattice covering an island, and it hums when the moon is
 up. A mountain hollowed into a bowl, and in its center, a silver spike a
 hundred spans high, and any who comes within a mile of it, dies. Rusted
 ruins, and broken bits, and things found on the bottom of the sea, things
 not even the oldest books know the meaning of. Ive gathered a few, myself.
 Things you never dreamed of, in more places than you can see in ten
 lifetimes. that be the strangeness that will draw you"

 -Bayle Doman
