  
  And men cried out to the Creator, saying, O light of
  the Heavens, Light of the World, let the Promised One
  be born of the mountain, according to the prophecies,
  as he was in Ages past and will be in Ages to come.
  Let the Prince of the Morning sing to the land that 
  green things may grow and the valleys give forth lambs.
  Let the arm of The Lord of the Dawn shelter us from
  the Dark, and the great sword of justice defend us. Let
  The Dragon ride again on the Wheels of Time.

  --from Charal Drianaan te Calamon,
          "The Cycle of the Dragon",
     Author unknown, the Fourth Age.
