  Twice and twice shall he be marked, twice to live, and twice to die.  Once
the heron, to set his path. Twice the heron, to name him true.  Once the
Dragon, for remembrance lost. Twice the Dragon, for the price he must pay.

  Twice dawns the day when his blood is shed.  Once for mourning, once for
birth.  Red on black, the Dragon's blood stains the rocks of Shayol Ghul. 
In the Pit of Doom shall his blood free men from the Shadow.
