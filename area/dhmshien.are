a Myrddraal~
A darkly cloaked figure looks about with a pale, eyeless grin.
~
A tall, lithe figure stands here.  A pale, eyeless face scans the room,
striking pure fear into all that the gaze falls upon.  Serpentine scale mail
covers its body, adding to the appearance of a snake stalking its prey.  All
of its armor is black, and the very presence of this creature seems to
absorb the light around it.  Silently it watches, preparing to exert
Shai'tan's will.

a Myrddraal~
A darkly cloaked figure eyelessly looks up from a table.
~
A tall slender figure, dressed all in black, looks up with a pale eyeless
gaze at those who would enter its sanctuary.  Standing taller than a normal
man, its small frame gives it a snake like appearance.  This creature wears
no armor, possibly because it is in such a well fortified location.  As it
pulls a dagger from its belt and smiles a cold bloodless smile, fear strikes
any whom its gaze touches.

A darkly armored figure overlooks a fist, tapping a whip upon its hand.
~
A tall, and almost muscular figure stands here.  Its eyeless face scans a
fist of trollocs menacingly.  As it observes and commands, it lightly taps a
whip upon its hand.  The trollocs it commands cowers from that stare and
whip, and obey their master's every command.  As it notices something out of
the ordinary, it smiles coldly as it orders the fist to kill.

A massive bird-like Trolloc of the Dha'vol tribe glares around.
~
This grotesque beast would appear to be a crude mix of some type of bird
and a human.  Tufts of strange and filthy feathers stick out from openings
in its armor and near its head.  It stands at least head and shoulders above
any normal man upon bird-like legs.  A bloody beak protrudes from its face
as it screeches and shouts.  It glares around itself, watching for something
to present itself, waiting for something to hunt.

taller than most of the other Dha'vol trollocs and taller than most of the

Muscles ripple beneath the thick shag fur of this goat-horned trolloc. 
Like many trollocs this deep in the Mountains of Dhoom, this Dha'vol trolloc
has a look of near frenzy enraging its eyes.  Its fur is matted and caked in
black oil, with barely legible runes and sigils marking it.  The crude
weapon it carries is something out of a nightmare, too unwieldy for human
hands and set with wrought-iron spikes.  The horns on its head are jagged
with splintered tips, as if it were more than ready to gore an opponent with
them in spite of its weapon.

A tall slender figure, dressed all in black, looks up with a pale eyeless
gaze at those who would enter its sanctuary.  Standing taller than a normal
man, its small frame gives it a snake like appearance.  This creature wears
no armor, possibly because it is in such a well fortified location.  As it
pulls a dagger from its belt and smiles a cold bloodless smile, fear strikes
any whom its gaze touches.

gaze at those who would enter its sanctuary.  Standing taller than a normal
man, its small frame gives it a snake like appearance.  This creature wears
no armor, possibly because it is in such a well fortified location.  As it
pulls a dagger from its belt and smiles a cold bloodless smile, fear strikes
any whom its gaze touches.

An enourmous worm-like beast crashes through the Blight.
~
Massive and deadly are the only words to describe this monstrosity. 
Along with its fellow worms, it travels the Great Blight in search of only
one thing, food.  It cares not about pain, fear, or sorrow, some say it
feels only hunger, and that constant and eternal.  Whenever it gets the
smell of food, regardless of loyalty or size, it enters a frenzy.  Some say
these deformed beasts of the Blight have only fallen to small armies, but
never when in a pack.

This deformity of the Creator's world stands silent and calm.  It stands
at the height of a normal man, yet its bloodless face, and black wings show
it to be far from normal.  It soars through the sky, shrieking its warning
to its fellow shadowspawn.  Normally it acts as the Great Lord's eyes in the
air, assisting his land based minions in their attacks.  As it lands before
its prey, a cold, calculating smile covers its lips.  It sings a calm and
comforting song, a song that seems to draw its victim in.  Despite the
fangs, the obvious evil, none may resist the song of the Draghkar.

The prickling feeling of eyes unseen is all the warning this beast gives

darkness of this place, constantly healing and repairing damage done.  It
thirsts only for the Great Lord's pleasure and contentment, an obedient and
most effective pet.

A Black Chamber~
No sound can be heard in this room, the silence so thick that it almost
seems tangible.  The walls and floor are made in black rock, smooth and
almost reflective, yet the floor is not slippery under foot.  Massive
tapestries, done in rich deep reds, blues, and heavy quantities of black,
hang about the room.  Each depicts a victory of the Trolloc Wars, and
successful raids within the Borderlands.  A small fireplace decorates the
northern wall, yet the flames provide no heat to this place.  Engraved
within the blackened stones of the fireplace, are the symbols of the
thirteen tribes of the Trollocs.  Shadows dance throughout the room, and the
feel of unseen eyes is almost overwhelming.

A Faint Trail Leading North~
The plain here seems to be beaten down into a very faint trail leading
north and south.  Off to the south, the outposts of Shienar can be seen,
standing silent and tall, the first line of defense against the Shadow's
minions.  North, stands the Great Blight.  The air feels warmer here, as
though the chill normally associated with Shienar has been wiped away.  Off
in the distance, dark clouds can be seen covering a long range of dark and
forbidding mountains.

The Beginning of the Great Blight~
The air turns much warmer here, and the foliage shows the reason why. 
Twisted and diseased, the plants display a myriad of color.  What at first
glance might be considered odd or even beautiful, at closer examination is
swollen and rotten.  Under foot, the grass and flowers can be heard
squishing as they burst from the pressure.  The smell of this place is
nothing but filth and disease.

A Decaying Path Through the Great Blight~
This small path disappears into the Great Blight to the north.  Plants,
diseased and swollen seem to slowly move across the pathway.  The
temperature would also seem to have risen, and the sun appears to be a
dismal blood red above.  The Mountains of Dhoom can be seen up ahead,
towering and dark against a strange black sky.  Twisted trees stand on all
sides of this pathway, and their branches sway.  Unfortunately, no wind
blows here.

The Path Leads East~
This fetid trail through the Dark One's twisted forest turns off to the
east here, leading toward slightly more up hill terrain.  Several pieces of
brush lay off to the sides, and some of the trees appear to be rotting where
they grow.  Fat, puss-filled leaves can be heard bursting nearby from time
to time.  Strange sounds come from up ahead, and the sounds of corrupted
plants being crushed can be heard as well.

A Winding Path through the Great Blight~
The beaten path here makes another turn north, leading more directly to
the massive mountains ahead.  Twisted and deformed trees that should not
survive line the path, and swollen and putrid underbrush fill in the spaces,
forcing all who would travel this path safely to stay upon the already
crushed foliage.  The start of a small hill can be seen ahead, and the
strange noises become louder.

The faint trail begins to slope uphill sharply, and the small path
appears to lead off to the east above.  Twisted and deformed trees line the
path, leaving no escape to either side.  The air here is thick with the
smell of death and decay, and the blood red sun beats down from above.  The
air here is sweltering and humid.  Strange noises seem to eminate from
nowhere and everywhere at once.

This small hill continues to rise above, yet the diseased brush above
does not provide a path.  The faint trail leads off to the east, slowly
rising upward.  The trees have thinned here, though once in awhile the fetid
wind stirs them slightly.  The path has become less pronounced here, and
some plants rest in the middle of the light trail.

The pathway moves upward once more here, more of a small crevice in the
hill than a true path, it provides a way up.  The trail has faded into
merely trampled brush.  Small plants and trees are scattered about the side
of this hill, and seem to stand in wait for something.  The diseased flowers
and plants make loud squishing noises as they are trampled upon.

A Haunting View~
At the top of this small hill, a dark sight greets all who would travel
here.  Off to the northeast, silent and dark, seven towers stand.  Broken
and ruined, they stand as a silent testament to the betrayal and power of
the Shadow.  Broken long ago, and consumed by the Great Blight not long
afterward, they stand diseased and corrupted just as everything else within
the Dark One's territory.  A massive ring of lakes, dark and blackened,
surround the once great kingdom of Malkier.  A small path seems to be
visible once more, barely seen to the north.

A Gentle Decline~
This side of the hill would appear to be far more easy to traverse than
the southern end.  The trail slopes downward in a gentle decline, into the
thick foliage of the Blight below.  Off to the northeast, something can just
barely be made out behind the trees.  It should be visible to the south, as
the trees are sparser there.  Trampled flowers and vines, putrid and puss
filled, lay about the pathway, giving sign that something still travels this
way.

Beneath the Looming Blood Red Sun~
The pathway here widens, and is solid dirt at least a few paces across. 
The trees are thick here, yet above, the deathy hot sun continues to beat
down.  Most of the trees here seem to be without leaves, and provide no
shade to any who would venture this deep into the Dark One's Blight.  Off to
the north, the bleak peaks of the Mountains of Dhoom rise up, towering above
everything within the blight.

Death and Decay~
The path here seems rather sheltered, as the thick and twisted trees
along it have grown so thickly and intangled that they partialy block the
path from the sun above.  The pathway here is definitely well beaten and
worn.  Small indentations within the hard ground can be seen clearly.  The
path winds its way to the east.

A clearing opens up here, providing relief from the dark tunnel created
by the trees.  Up above, the sky seems to have made a transition.  Strange
clouds coat the sky.  Various colors, unnatural for any place other than the
Blight, cover the heavens.  Streaks of lightning seem to jump from cloud to
cloud.  The clouds stir and churn, as though a great storm were unleashing
its fury against the Blight, yet no rain falls.

Several small foothills rise up here, just beneath the Mountains of
Dhoom.  The heat of the dark sun fills this place, and the sky above would
be enough to strike fear into the hearts of southlanders.  A fetid wind
blows across the hills, bringing with it the smell of the grave.  The wind
provides no comfort from the sun above, seemingly increasing the heat rather
than removing it.  The Mountains rise up to the north, cold and forbidding
against an electrified sky.

Small footholds and crevices provide a pathway this far, and the trail

rise, leading to the base of the first mountain.  Dense foliage covers all
of the ground and creates a solid path.  A calm howl can be heard in the
distance, and one might swear that the Blight stirs.

Gently the path leads upward again, gradually inclining toward the
massive rock face up ahead.  The vegetation ends up ahead, yet here the
trees and underbrush are thick.  Most of the foliage is diseased and dying,
if not dead already.  Slime and filth cover most everything here.  The
infernal sun beats down heavily, yet somehow seems to fit the electrified
sky above.

At the Base of the Mountain~
The base of the Mountains of Dhoom stands here, silent and forbidding. 
Rumors and tales from the borderlands say that most things from the southern
half of the Blight fear those things within the mountains.  The rock face
here rises up toward the foul sky above, black and cold.  There are multiple
footholds here, making the treacherous climb possible for the more
experienced of borderlanders.  The wind of the blight stirs slightly, and
the rock is somehow not nearly as warm as one might expect in this
sweltering heat.

This is a small ledge upon the side of the massive tower of rock.  Up
above, the rock is smooth and devoid of hand-holds or crevices.  At this
level, the tops of several twisted trees can be seen, yet a few tower
slightly higher.  The ledge leads off to the west, or it is possible to
climb back down, so long as caution is taken.

The thin pathway along the side of the mountain continues to the west, or
heads back toward the decent to the east.  The rock is barely wide enough
for one person, and does not easily accomodate a group.  The fetid stench of
the Great Blight seems to fill the air, and is freshly renewed with each
blast of the hot breeze flowing here.  Small amounts of moss grow upon the
pathway, yet no other vegetation can be seen.

against the evil sky.

The bleak mountain provides little reassurance as it is ascended.  Small
bits of rock and stone crumble as they are grasped, and cascade down the
face.  Nothing grows here, and the mountain face is completely verticle,
providing little rest for any who would begin the climb.  The hot wind tugs
at clothing, and instantly heats any who would climb here.  This place
eminates pure evil.

the pass is irregular in shape.  Down below, the Great Blight spreads out,
still rather visible for the decayed forest that it is.  The stench of decay
fills the air, even at this altitude.  The rocky pass is off to the north.

it the stench of decay.  The sounds of movement seem to echo from somewhere
ahead, or perhaps above.

can be seen.  At this height, one could almost not notice the utter
destruction of the land below.  The smell here is horrific, the damp stench
of decay and fetid undergrowth seems to collect and suffocate.  The black
rock of the mountain rises up to the north, and it would appear that this
wall is climbable.

path leads.  A calm wind flows through this place, yet it is hot and smells
of something rotten.  From time to time, the paws of some strange beast
appear, seemingly carved into the very rock itself.  The lightning streaked
sky above gives a disturbing backdrop even here, in the very heart of the
Dark One's territory.

barren of everything but blackened earth and stone.  In the distance to the

from the north, carrying the smell of an old grave reopened.  Nothing grows
here, and nothing provides much shelter for concealment.

bushes line the rocks to the east and west, and the top of a small crack can

further into the bowels of this mountain.  High above the sun still looms.

This small cavern seems only large enough for a single person at a time. 
The walls here are tight for a large man, and simple to pass for the more
slight of frame.  Rough stairs seem to have been hewn into the rock, and
lead downward at a steep angle.  The temperature within this place seems to
decrease more as one travels further downward.  The walls here are still
black and forbidding, and yet are smooth as glass, gleaming in the
torchlight.

The fear and darkness of the Great Blight seems to disappear here. 
Nestled deep within the rock, a small cavern opens up here.  A firepit sits
in the middle of this place, and ashes indicate that it is frequently
visited.  The air is cool and pleasant here, and from somewhere unknown a
gentle breeze flows.  Several pallats lay about the area, covered with
animal skins and straw.  The walls here are smooth and glossy black,
refracting the smallest light and illuminating the entire room.  One might
wonder how such a place came into existance, or one might just enjoy the
safety.

A Sharp Climb~
The steep wall continues high into the sky of the Blight.  Jagged
precipices stick out from the wall in various places.  To the east and west,
the rock surrounds this wall.  Just above, the rock face opens up once more.

Small Footholds~
The hand and footholds here diminish and get smaller in size.  The wall
opens out into the Great Blight once more, and the hot wind whips across the
rock face.  Up above, the red sun of the Dark One's nation boils, heating
everything it's light touches.

The hand holds diminish to the point that only one person at a time can
successfully negotiate this climb.  Just above, a massive ledge hangs out
above the mountain pass below.  The summit above appears to be the highest
point of this mountain that can be reached by any climber.  Far below, the
path and pass dwindle in size.

Overlooking the Southern Half of the Great Blight~
The view from this rocky point is vile at best.  The southern portion of
the Great Blight lies below, the twisting trees and decaying plants far
below seem an array of dark shades and color, yet the stench here seems to
be increased.  A hot wind flows across the mountain, bringing with it the
smell of a fresh grave, and the smell of death itself.

Upward and upward, to dizzying heights the rock face climbs.  Up above,
the oddly colored and tumultuous sky whirls and churns.  Down below, the
twisted and corrupted vegetation of the blight lays.  From this height, a
fall would most assuredly bring about a quick end.  Survival would mean a
long and painful death at the hands of the shadow's creatures.

large rocky ledge can be seen sticking out over the Blight.  Up above, the
mountain appears to be split, possibly indicating a mountain pass.  Sounds
from above can be just barely heard over the hard gusts of wind that seem to
have increased with altitude.  Down below, the floor of the Blight is a
twisted black and colored floor.

Upon the Summit of the Mountains of Dhoom~
This summit, upon the highest point within the Mountains of Dhoom, looks
out across the northern portion of the Great Blight, and toward Shayol Ghul
itself.  The mountain known throughout the ages as Shayol Ghul stands
ominous and dark.  Several dimly lit caves can be seen within the small
foothills of the dark mountain, and a few within the mountain itself. 
Somewhere within, the Bore lays sealed.  Somewhere down there, Thakan'dar
steel is being forged in the fires of the Dark One's lair.  The air no
longer has the smell of the Blight, but solely the smell of the grave
itself.  Smoke rises steadily from vents near the top of Shayol Ghul, rising
steadily to the boiling sky.  The mountain path leads downward here, toward
the ominous black mountain, and the very Bore itself.

A Deadly Decline~
***OOC*** Ok Phil, This is the pseudo end of the area.  I'll add a few
more declines and 'twisting paths' taking them down to the next 'blight'
sector.  The next expanse should be a rather small '20 room' area of the
second blight area mentioned in RJ's maps.  After that would be an entryway
into SG and Thakan'dar forges.  (I think we should have a shopkeeper in
there with Thakan'dar blades, perhaps fade only in the event we ever have a
fade race;) ) I'm going to be adding lots of hidden rooms in this first
part, including a cave system with a trolloc 'home' in it.  Basically a
group of rooms filled to the brim with REAL pissed off trollocs.  I'm also
going to add a little bit to the 'Malkieri' pathway going west....  And push
the 'link' east a few.  
If you are reading this...note me with an opinion.

A Massive Stairwell~
The heat seems to rise further down this passage.  The stairwell seems
incredibly large for any human to pass through, rising hands above the
tallest man's head.  No torches line the walls, plunging this place into
absolute darkness.  The noises below become louder, gutteral shouts and
howls eminating from below.

ceiling stands well above the head of even a tall human, and an Ogier would
clear it by a few paces at least.  No light can be seen within this passage,
and the end is unseen.  The shouts and howls echo within this place,

As the hallway turns north here, a doorway can be seen up ahead.  The
shouts and noise suddenly increases after rounding the corner.  The room up
ahead would appear to be dimly lit at best, providing only more light than
what is in the hallway.  The doorway appears to have once held a door, but
has long since been ripped from it's hinges.

stand guard here, wearing the insignia of the Ko'Bal tribe.  The walls here
are roughly carved, giving rise to a ceiling that seems rather smooth and
well designed.  A massive passageway leads to the east, and the gutteral

This roughly hewn cave would appear to be a savage and vile place. 
Though the residents call it a dining room, most would call it a butcher's
scrap pile.  Strips and chunks of flesh and other unidentifiable body parts
from an unknown assortment of creatures are scattered about the room.  Stone
slabs that act as tables are a deep crimson in color, perhaps from years of
this type of use.  Four massive hearths stand upon the northern wall, each
with a fire lit and a cookpot brewing.

Several pairs of trollocs mate here, and their young run about the room,
snarling and growling in their youthful voices.  Several humans move nimbly
about the room, separating those young who are throwbacks, and will
eventually become myrddraal.  Filth and corruption fill this room.

A massive, roughly hewn room opens up here.  Looking to be several spans
in length and width, it could only be called a living area.  Straw and cloth
are strewn about the room, possibly as make shift beds for the massive
occupants.  From time to time, hastily scrawled writing in the Trolloc
scratch can be seen, sometimes written in mud or carved, yet sometimes
written in a red liquid.  The noise of the horde of trollocs is deafening
here, and they all look to see who would dare enter such a place.

This cave has obviously been carved into the stone.  The entryway is a
massive opening, easily large enough for a massive Ogier.  The heat within
is nearly unbearable for someone used to more temperate climates.  Heat and
humidity mix to form weather that dampens everything.  No torches can be
seen within the place, and the light brought in seems to shy away from the
blackened walls.  Loud howling and screams can be heard from somewhere
below, and a dark stairway leads into the bowels of the mountain.

massive row of garrisons stand watch against the Blight.  Solid and well

Ahead the pathway seems to vanish into the darkness of the Blight. 
Periodically one of the native inhabitants of this place makes its presence
known, either with a piercing howl or the sound of crushing underbrush.  The
smell of death and decay fills this place like a blanket, and the strange
sky above completes the feeling.  The pathway leads to the west as well, and
back toward Shienar.

Mounting one of the Foothills~
A small hill rises here, leading toward the dark rock of the Mountains of
Dhoom.  The very air seems to bear the darkness and evil within this place. 
The thick trees above provide only glimpses of the rock formation to the
north.  The sounds of unkown creatures moving fills the air, and something
lurks within the trees.

Lightly Trampled Brush~
The path seems to fade into non-existance here, swallowed up by the
seemingly untouched underbrush.  Thick trees surround this small clearing,
yet it would appear that one might be able to continue on.  The mountain
rises up to the north, barely visible through the canopy of rotted trees
above.

A Rock Face Looms Ahead~
Up ahead another hill can be seen rising, dark and rocky.  A lone howl
echoes across the landscape of the Great Blight, and the thick trees above
provide little light in this area.  There is no visible path here, and the
area seems an endless sea of diseased forest.

A Rocky Climb~
The floor of the Blight rises up into a hill once more.  No paths lead in
or out of this place, those who would travel here must be adept at
pathfinding.  The thick canopy above blocks out any view of the mountains
ahead, yet somewhere they loom.  The Blight is restless, the sounds of
something unseen can be heard off in the distance.

The Foothills of the Great Mountains of Dhoom~
The pathway reappears here.  A broad, heavily trampled span of dirt leads
up to the bottom of the mountain.  The trees above have thinned, and provide
a bleak vision of the Mountains of Dhoom and the bloody sun above.  All
around, small plants can be seen dying or dead.

At the Base of the Mountains of Dhoom~
The black rock of the mountain range rises up above here.  The trees make
a clearing several paces away from the rock face.  Only the faintest of
hand-holds are visible, and the climb looks to be treacherous at best.  High
above, the upper passes of the mountains can be seen against the electric
sky.  Somewhere upon the other side, Shayol Ghul and the Dark One's escape,
the Bore, are located.

The Handholds End~
This rock ledge seems to go straight into the sky of the Great Blight. 
Very few hand holds can be seen, and those that are found sometimes crumble
when touched.  Far below, the floor of the Great Blight can be seen, making
a deadly safety net in the event that someone should fall.

The First Line of Defense~
A massive row of towers spreads out to the east and west here, solid and
ready as they stand watch just south of the Great Blight.  The grass this
far north appears to be dead or dying, and is closely cut to avoid an ambush
on one of the garrisons.  The garrisons are spread out evenly, running a
straight line all the way across the Blight.

A Northern Garrison~
This garrison represents Shienar's first line of defense against the
Shadow.  Solid and well built, it houses some ten to twenty soldiers that
defend the Borderlands every day.  A small table and chairs are set off to
the side, providing a make-shift eating area, and a small hatch leads
underground.  A spiraling stairway leads upstairs, winding its way around
the outer edge of the building.

Here the watch truly stands.  A large opening on each side provides a
clear view of all the land up to the Blight's border.  Arrow-slits can be
seen in between each of the larger openings, in the event that cover is
needed.  A massive mirror stands at the ready, prepared to relay messages
down the line in the event that the Blight stirs.

An Underground Bunker~
This small, underground area would appear to be the garrison's sleeping
quarters.  The place is well lit by torches and several of the Shienaran
soldiers lay about on cots as they catch some rest between long shifts.  The
air here remains at a constant temperature, as it is not as affected by the
heat or cold of the outside air.

A Pass Leads in to the Rock~
A small pathway leads down the mountain, hand holds and foot holds
crumbling and dangerous.  The pathway also leads off to the east, and toward
what might be a cave of some sort.  Large impressions are made upon the
rock, and a lone howl breaks the silence.  A hot wind crashes through the
pathway, stirring dust to reveal some of the marks, and hide others.

prints~
Upon closer examination of the prints, they would appear to be those of a
large dog, although they are burned into the rock itself.  They seem to lead
back and forth in a random pattern, but there are many of them.

A Dark Tunnel through the Mountain~
The pathway here leads into a dark tunnel that appears to have been
carved straight through the mountain.  Pawprints can be seen here clearly,
as the wind has died down in this area.  The smell of a rotted grave fills
the air, and the heat of the Great Blight beats at any who would enter.

A Pass to the North~
The small tunnel abruptly ends in another opening to the north.  The
sounds of something unknown echo from the north.  The rock surrounding this
tunnel sometimes creates a shower of dust, as though even the rock is
rotting as it stands.  The pass leads on to the north, and the smell of
death grows.

A Large Damp Cave~
This large cave has the feel of a sickly rotting coffin compared to the
drier air outside.  The heat is sweltering despite the shade.  Roughly hewn
walls rise up to a ceiling that would permit an Ogier to stand at full
height.  Monstrous howls and shouts can be heard from the bottom of a
stairwell that leads into the depths of this mountain.  The walls of this
place seem to fight against the light from any torch.

A Small Pass Within the Mountain~
The pass opens up into another pass, completely surrounded by rock.  From
this vantage point, it would appear that the pathway ends in a sheer cliff
to the north.  Pawprints mark the pathway heavily, and the dank wind pulls
the dust off of more.  A putrid smell fills this place, and the air is thick
with varying smells.

The passage ends abruptly here in a vertical rock face to the north.  The
tracks in the stone however, lead to a crack that appears to have been hewn
into the rock to the east.  The fetid wind pounds its way across the
pathway, and something stirs within the crevice.

A Rocky Crevice~
This cave appears smooth on all sides.  No dust marks the paw-print
covered floor, and an erie silence suddenly decends upon this place.  The
passage leads off to the east, the darkness concealing whatever may lurk
there.  To the north, a large hole is bored into the rock, and the
paw-prints lead into it.  The smell of death hangs heavily here, but the
faint odor of something else appears now, too faint for even those with the
most keen sense of smell.

A sudden change in the air here can be felt.  Suddenly the air is
somewhat cooler than that of the cave to the south.  The humidity of this
place has also risen.  A winding pathway leads down within the rock, its
bottom unable to be seen.  Something can be heard from somewhere below,
distantly similar to the sound of heavy breathing.

Into the Mountain~
All noise from below ceases here.  This place feels almost cold.  The air
is still and calm, and something can be clearly smelled now.  Something
burning, something perhaps like, sulphur.  The moisture in this cave seems
thick enough to drink, and leaves a sickly fetid taste upon the tongue.

The source of the sounds can be found here.  A larger cave opens up here,
a cold wind whipping through the place.  Pawprints mar the ground
everywhere, and the walls bear a resemblance to a blackened mirror.  A small
pack of Darkhounds, who appear to reside here, move from their places of
hiding, to stare at those who were foolish enough to stumble into their
lair.  The air is cold and icly, and the moisture that hangs almost seems on
the point of freezing everything upon an instant.

Amidst the Black Stone Walls~
Onward the dark pass continues, moving its way through rock as black as
night.  The silence that comes from time to time, as though this place were
catching its breath, could make even the most battle hardened step warily. 
The putrid, hot wind of this place picks up the black dust from time to
time, and swirls it up into the air.  A massive wall of rock appears to
block the pass west of here.

still in this place, the rock walls providing some shelter from its hot
grasp.  As a scream shatters the sudden silence, the Great Blight seems to
come alive once more.
