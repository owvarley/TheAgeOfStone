if he sells and trades off enough items each day.

young aiel warrior boy~
a young Aiel warrior~
A young Aiel warrior is here staring out in the distance.
~
This young Aiel is here contemplating his future.  He has several warrior
societies that he is trying to decide between.  His heart is that of a
warrior, and his spirit is strong and unyielding, so he may choose to be a
member of the Stone Dogs.  He believes in fairness and the honor of keeping
the peace, so he may instead choose the Red Shields.  He is very swift and
stealthy, something he prides himself on, and that may lead him to the Night
Spears.  Even with all of that, he also realizes he is as equally deadly
with his hands and feet as he is with his spear, so the Knife Hands also
catch his interest.  All in all, the only warrior society he knows for sure
he will not join is Far Dareis Mai, The Maidens of the Spear.

portal~
For now, a shimmering rift in the Age Lace has been ripped, possibly by
an incredible surge of Balefire from an unknown source.  On the other side
of the portal you see what looks to be a large nursery of sorts, horribly
distorted and with creatures that could only be of the Shadow's brood.  
 
This is a VERY ooc portal to the absolute COOLEST newbie area ever to
be built on a WoT Mud, Brian's Shadowspawn Nursery.  Make sure you keep
your milk far away, or it'll probably be coming through your nose.
Just 'enter portal' and enjoy!

A Small Clearing Near Alcair Dal~
Here the ground has been packed flat and turned up with the tracks of the
many Aiel who pass by here.  To the north is the mountain range that Alcair
Dal lies within.  Alcair Dal is where the thirteen clans meet under a peace
akin to that of Rhuidean, to discuss matters that affect the people as a
whole.  To the east is a large tent belonging to one of the Wise Ones.  To
the west is a sweat tent.  The path to the south winds between some more
tents before leading out of the gathering.

Entrance to Alcair Dal~
This low, wide, hollow before the mountain range serves as a gathering
place and a sort of market for those clans who have come to meet at Alcair
Dal.  The ground here is cracked and baked clay that has been worn with the
footprints of the many Aiel here at the gathering.  Several tents lie to the
east and to the west all along the foot of these low mountains.  Many
craftsmen have come to sell their wares here to the various clans.  To the
north is a steep-walled gorge that is deep and darkly-shadowed.  The gorge
cuts north into the mountains, leading to Alcair Dal.

A Deep Gorge Leading into Alcair Dal~
Here in the gorge, the dark shadows cool the air, and bring a little
relief from the heat of the day.  The walls of the gorge rise sharply,
nearly vertical.  Streaked into the walls of the gorge are clays of yellow
and red.  At times, when the sun is overhead and beats down upon the center
of the gorge, the clay glitters in the sunlight.  The gorge itself is very
peaceful and quiet, but much can be heard beyond the gorge to the north, and
to the south.  The gorge leads back out to the gathering at the foot of the
mountain to the south, and continues on further to the north, leading to
Alcair Dal.

Alcair Dal~
Alcair Dal, translated from the Old Tongue as "The Golden Bowl", is the
gathering place of the thirteen Clans of the Aiel.  There is a agreement of
peace within the desert surrounding the Bowl, similar to the peace of
Rhuidean.  The Aiel gather to the Bowl at the call of the Clan Chiefs, to
discuss matters that concern the people as a whole.  Although shaped much
like a bowl, there is nothing golden about it.  Much like a bowl, Alcair Dal
is almost perfectly round.  The gray walls slope all the way around, except
at the far end, where it curls inward like a breaking wave.  At the far end
of the bowl to the north, there is a ledge where the speakers stand on, and
their voice can be heard all through the bowl.  The gorge to the south leads
out of Alcair Dal to the gathering.

A Wise One's Tent~
Here in the Wise One's tent, there are many pillows piled neatly in
several spots for visitors to sit and rest on.  A fine silver teapot and
several tea cups sit on a stand for the Wise One and her guests to drink and
enjoy.  The flaps of the tent are normally pulled closed for privacy so the
Wise One can work without interruption.  While the Wise One may spend most
of her time helping to resolve arguments and settle disputes, some of her
time is spent tending to the sick and wounded, either with herbs and
bandages, or use of the One Power.

The Tent of a Craftsman~
This tent is the temporary home and shop for a very special Aiel
craftsman.  While here at Alcair Dal, this man not only trades his wares
from this tent, but has to sleep here as well.  He is considered a very
intelligent man, and his customers leave very pleased as he teaches them the
proper use and care for the wares they get from him.

Approaching Alcair Dal~
Here the hard ground has been churned with the steps of the many Aiel who
are travelling to and from Alcair Dal.  A mountain range rises to the north
and spreads wide, from east to west.  At the base of the mountain are dozens
and dozens of tents, housing the many Aiel who have gathered at Alcair Dal. 
To the south, a dwindling path leads away from Alcair Dal towards desolate
sands and open horizons.  The mountains are jagged earthen slabs of brown
and gray stone, streaked with clay of yellow or red that sometimes glitter
in the sunlight.

A Path Through the Gathering~
This path leads through the gathering at the base of the mountain.  Tents
and crowds gather south of here, to the east and to the west.  The ground,
normally baked and cracked, is well-worn with the footprints of the many
Aiel here at the gathering.  To the west is the entrance into Alcair Dal, a
deep gouge that leads through the shadows and into the heart of the mountain
range itself.  To the east the path continues on through the gathering, and
past more tents.

A Path Through the Gathering~
This path meanders through the crowd along the base of the mountain,
sometimes coming near the sloping mountainside.  All along the southern edge
of the path, Aiel gather in groups and in tents, talking and trading.  The
ground has seen so much travel, that the normally hard-baked clay has been
churned into a fine dust that is sometimes blown about by the wind.  To the
west is the entrance into Alcair Dal.  To the east, the path continues on
through the gathering past past more people and tents.  To the south lies a
small trickle of a well where the Aiel can get water.

quite crowded.  Many Aiel walk along the slope of the mountain to get around
the crowd.  Off to the west is the entrance into Alcair Dal itself.  The
path continues on to the east through the gathering, and another path is
open to the south that leads in between the tents.

Many Aiel walk along the path here, dodging each other and occassionally
having to clambor along the slope to get past one another.  The ground that
is normally very hard and baked by the sun has been churned into a fine dust
that is blown about by the wind.  The path continues along between the foot
of the mountain and the tents to the south.  The path runs to the west
towards where the entrance into Alcair Dal itself, and to the east, where
the crowding looks to be less.  A large tent is to the south, most likely
for meetings.

and occassionally having to clambor along the slope to get past each other. 
The ground that is normally very hard and baked by the sun has been churned
into a fine dust that is blown about by the wind.  The path continues along

seems to dwindle towards the animal shelters.  A large tent lies to the
south, most likely for meetings.  The entrance to the large tent is to the
west.

Onward the path leads through the gathering, sometimes so close to the

through the crowd.  Tents and crowds gather south of here, to the east and
to the west.  The ground, normally baked and cracked, is well-worn with the
footprints of the many Aiel here at the gathering.  To the east is the

circle, creating an open span of ground where there looks to be some
activity.

A Path Through the Gathering~
Here the crowd seems to lessen a little, and most seem to be entering or
leaving the tent to the south, where the rich aroma of leather is wafting
out of.  The ground, normally baked and cracked, is well-worn with the
footprints of the many Aiel here at the gathering.  Many tents lie all along
the southern side of the path, surrounded by many Aiel who are clustered
together in groups, talking and trading.  Distant to the east is the
entrance into Alcair Dal itself.  To the west the path continues on through
the gathering, and past more tents.

The crowds are sparse here, and the path is clear and open with room to
move around.  Many more crowds and tents lie to the east, closer to the
entrance to Alcair Dal itself.  The ground, normally baked and cracked, is
well-worn with the footprints of the many Aiel here at the gathering. 
Directly to the south is a tent, where many Aiel leave with much different
items than they entered with, most likely a trader or some such.  To the
west, the gathering thins out as the path leads out of the encampment.

A Path Through the Gathering~
Here the gathering is very sparse, and hardly any Aiel make their way
this far west of the entrance into Alcair Dal itself.  Rarely do any of the
Aiel venture out this way, but when they do, it is to look for food most
likely.  No tents lie nearby, but more to the east a few Aiel cluster
together in groups to talk and trade.  To the west, the path dies off into a
lingering trail that just meanders off into the distance.

An Open Span of Ground~
The ground here has been beaten flat and hard.  A single step upon it
rises a dustcloud a mere inch from ground before quickly settling back down.
Stains of blood are walked over uncaringly, and the pieces of missing and
chipped teeth that lie on the ground are kicked aside in an unsympathetic
manner.  A single man here has wrought this damage upon the fallen, yet they
keep coming back, because this man has what it takes to see they survive
their next Dance with honor.

Food and Water~
Here near to the base of the mountain range, the hard ground has been dug
out for a shallow well to provide water for those encamped nearby.  When
water is not being drawn, a leather tarp covers the opening of the well to
keep it from drying up too quickly.  Some of the Aiel also gather here to
trade and sell their food and other items.

An Unmarked Trail~
This is not much of a trail, as it is just beyond the edge of the
gathering into what is much harsher and rockier terrain than that near the
tents.  There are many more rocks here, some as big as a man, and the only
plants that grow near here are stunted trees or bushes that are covered in
thorns.  To the west, the terrain gets worse, and the trail less noticeable.
To the east the terrain gets easier as it nears the gathering and the tents.

An Unmarked Trail~
To the normal eye, this would not be considered a trail, but as it is the
only passable path to traverse this rough terrain, it is used some.  The
trail continues on to the south past stunted bushes full of thorns into what
looks to be harsher and rockier terrain.  To the east, the terrain gets a
little easier closer to the gathering.

An Unmarked Trail~
Here the trail bends around a large boulder, continuing to the west and
to the north.  The trail drops off to the south and east, down a steep rock
face and into what may be thorny bushes and brambles.  The rocks and
boulders seem to get larger and more difficult to pass by this far from
Alcair Dal.  There does not seem to be any water or food nearby, and no
animals can be seen.

Above a Patch of Thorny Bushes~
The trail comes to an end here.  There are rocks and boulders all around,
and the only way to continue would be to climb down a short rock face and
into a patch of thorn bushes.  Why any person would venture into those
bushes is unknown.  There are the sounds of some small animals down in the
bushes, but it is undeterminable what kind.

Thorny Bushes~
Thorn bushes surround this area, blocking any easy passage.  The only
visible way out is up, back onto the trail.  There are disturbing sounds of
small animals moving close to the ground and rustling through the thorn
bushes.  Occassionally a gray-nosed hare may pop into view, but there are
other sounds coming from nearby that are surely not a hare.  The overhang of
the area here blocks out the sun and provides little respite, but at the
cost of vision.  A deep shade causes everything to be lost from sight.

An Anthill~
Here the brambles and thorn bushes are cleared away near an indentation
in the rock face.  The plant life was likely cleared away by the huge
anthill here that rises from the ground.  Hundreds of little red ants make
their way in and out of the anthill, some with tiny bits of food.  The
ravenous ants can quickly overcome any small prey that comes to close to
their habitat, making the anthill a safe dwelling for the ants and their
queen.

Thorny Bushes~
Thorn bushes surround this area, blocking any easy passage.  There are
disturbing sounds of small animals moving close to the ground and rustling
through the thorn bushes.  Occassionally a hare may pop into view, but there
are other sounds coming from nearby that a hare cannot make.  Some of the
branches rise overhead, blocking out the sunlight, but also holding in the
heat.

A Nest in the Thicket~
Here the thicket has been pulled away just enough to expose a nest of
hares.  The young are snuggled in, feeling warm and protected in their nest
that is surrounded by the concave rock face and the dense thicket.  There is
an unusually large amount of young here, most likely from several adult
hares, as many of the adults come and go, checking on the nest while they
search for food for the young.

The Tent of a Leatherworker~
This tent smells rich with the aroma of freshly tanned and many untanned
leathers.  Many pieces have already been worked and finished, and are ready
for trade.  Several large pieces of tanned bullhide hang from the back of
the tent, ready to be worked, while several bundles have yet to be even
tanned.  The leatherworker moves about the tent, busily displaying his wares
for barter.

The Tent of an Aiel Trader~
This tent at first appears very messily arranged, but upon closer
inspection, it is obvious that the merchandise is bartered for so often,
that the trader never has a chance to arrange or neaten anything.  There are
a few items that seem part of the trader's regular stock and they are neatly
arranged, unlike the majority of the other pieces.  The trader is always
ready to make a deal.

The Meeting Tent for the Sept Chiefs~
This large tent has been set up for the Sept Chiefs and the occassional
Clan Chief.  Here they gather to discuss water rights and treaties, and
relax a little while doing so.  The tent is comfortably set with wetlander
pillows of silk, arranged all throughout the tent for the Chiefs to sit on
without crowding.  The shade of the tent provides a welcome relief from the
merciless wrath of the sun upon the Three-fold Land.

A Path Between the Tents~
This is a narrow path that winds between the tents and through the crowd.
Food and water is available to the west where a well has been dug, and a
vendor provides food.  The smell of cooked goat mixes with the sharp odor of
peppers to fill the air with an enticing aroma.  This path continues on to
the south towards more tents, and to the north to join the path at the base
of the mountain.

The crowd is not overwhelming here, but the the space between the tents
is not very large either, so the crowding is still noticeable.  The normally
baked ground has been beaten to a fine dust here.  The dust is caught in the
breeze that filters in between the tents and is blown into the eyes of
anyone who is not wise enough to have their face covered.  The path leads
between more tents to the north and to the east.

A Path Through the Gathering~
Here the jagged mountainside rises to the north side of the path and the
Aiel must crowd together due to the path narrowing.  The dust-covered ground
is churned into cloud of grit and dust from all the people walking through
the gathering.  The path continues to the west, closer to the entrance to
Alcair Dal itself.  To the east, the gathering seems to dwindle off into
desolation, towards the animal shelters.  To the south, a narrow path leads
between some tents.

animals can be heard, and several large clumps of tough grass can be seen. 
To the west, the gathering at Alcair Dal seems to get more crowded and
louder.  The mountainside looms upward to the north, providing no easy
passage for even a goat.

The ground here has been beaten and worn from the many tracks of the Aiel
who pass through going to and from the gathering.  The tents and crowd are
visible to the west through the dust that is being blown about in the
breeze.  To the north is a large mountain range that runs from east to west.
The echoes of merchants are carried on the soft wind that passes near Alcair
Dal, but neither offers refuge from the merciless sun beating upon the
Three-fold Land.

The ground here has been worn from baked clay to a fine dust from the
Aiel who pass by here from the gathering.  The worn ground makes a path of
sorts that continues on to the south towards herds gathered around patches
of the tough, tall grass.  To the east, a natural rock formation has created
a path that looks to wind along the base of the mountain up towards the top
of a mesa.  To the west, the path leads back to the gathering, the tents,
and the crowd.

that have been herded towards the grass to graze.  To the south, there are

A Pasture~
This area of tall, tough grass was chosen for the sheep to graze on.  The
sheep are needed not only for trade, but possibly for food throughout the
gathering at Alcair Dal.  These sheep in particular, are owned by the Jumai
sept of the Shaido Aiel.  Possibly before the end of the gathering, another
sept or clan will own these sheep.  A shepherd guards the sheep day and
night from raiders, and to keep them from straying.

full of arrows, quivers, bows and bow-cases.  The fletcher looks up from his
work, and nods before returning to his work.  He finishes up what he is
doing before he helps any would-be customers, and the customers do not seem

This tent belongs to a silversmith.  While he is not here at Alcair Dal
to sell his wares, he has come here to acquire more silver for his work.  He
normally prefers to get his silver either from nuggets or from coinage
brought from the Wetlands.  He has a small pile of silver pennies he has
traded for so far, but he has yet to trade for a proper weight of silver.

Off to the north, a mountain range covers the horizon from east to west.  To
the south, this trail looks to disappear into unremarkable brush, rocks and
sand.  The mountains are jagged earthen slabs of brown and gray stone,
streaked with clay of yellow or red that sometimes glitter in the sunlight.

Open Horizons~
The view from the top of the mesa is wide and expansive.  The horizon is
clear and visible to the south, east and west for several leagues.  To the
west, there is a very long drop down to the rocky Lands below.  To the
south, east and north, there are more segade and rock formations that dot
the top of the mesa.  The ground slopes gently downward towards a natural
path along the base of the mountain, to the northwest.  The droppings of a
gara lizard can be seen here in the sand in a few places.

A Capar Den~
This den was created from a natural overhang in the rock face that was
further burrowed out by the adult capar.  The floor of the den is covered
with small pieces of dried brush, twigs and weeds that provide a little
comfort from the ground.  The small cavern grows narrower and the ceiling
gets lower deeper into the den.  The opening to the south leads back out of
the den towards the mesa.

A Sorda Nest~
This nest is made from twigs and the bones of dead animals that did not
make it through the thicket.  The sorda rip the flesh from the victims and
leave the bones to pile here in their nest, where they just place twigs on
top of the mess to cover it.  In every direction but the west, a rock face
blocks travel.  To the west, the thicket makes travel painful at the least.

Before a Gathering at Alcair Dal~
Here the ground has been churned and turned up with the tracks of the
many Aiel who pass through.  To the north is the mountain range that Alcair
Dal lies within.  Alcair Dal is where the thirteen clans meet under a peace
akin to that of Rhuidean, to discuss matters that affect the people as a
whole.  To the east is the tent of a craftsman who specializes in engraving
and carving.  To the west is the tent of a honored craftsman who is
bartering a few of his wares.  To the south, the path leads away from the
gathering towards open ground.

Before a Sweat Tent~
Here is the entrance to the sweat tent.  The sweat tent is a low tent
that is staked tightly down all around.  The smoke hole has been covered up
to keep the steam inside the tent.  A pile of clothes lie neatly stacked
beside the entrance of the tent where a gai'shain watches over them to keep
snakes away from the clothing.  Make sure to remove all clothing before
(typing) <enter tent> and enjoying the relaxing steam.

An Engraver~
Several tools line a make-shift bench built from bull-hide stretched taut
over a wood frame.  A few large, flat rocks provide a smooth working surface
and the leverage sometimes needed for carving.  A few very small casks of
dye are set to the back of the tent and are very rare and valuable here in
the Three-fold Land.  The craftsman is eager to help any customers with
their choices of design in personalizing their items (help restringer).

Inside a Sweat Tent~
This is a very low tent that is only tall enough to stand upright at the
very center where the hot coals are.  At the top center of the tent, the
smoke hole has been covered to keep the steam in the tent.  A large kettle
full of hot rocks and coals produces the steam when water is sprinkled into
the kettle.  A smaller kettle sits nearby storing extraordinarily hot rocks
and coals that are slowly added to the larger kettle to keep it hot.  The
ground inside the tent has been swept of rocks, but no other furnishings are
needed for comfort.  Type <enter doorway> to exit the sweat tent at any
time.

Atop a Low Rise~
Here the ground rises up enough to give a clear view to the north and to
the south.  To the north, there is long, wide hollow at the base of the
mountain range where a fair of sorts has been gathered.  Tents and pavilions
line the hollow from east to west, with many Aiel wandering in the midst of
the gathering.  To the south, the land stretches on, endless and expansive. 
The mountains are jagged earthen slabs of brown and gray stone, streaked
with clay of yellow or red that sometimes glitter in the sunlight.

Uneven Ground~
Here the dusty, rock-strewn ground is a touch uneven and requires a
careful step or the loss of an ankle for punishment.  A very rough mountain
range is to the north, colored brown and gray mostly, but with enough reds
and yellows to be noticeable.  To the immediate north, there is a low rise
that blocks the view of the base of the mountain.  The mountains are jagged
earthen slabs of brown and gray stone, streaked with clay of yellow or red
that sometimes glitter in the sunlight.  To the west, several hills rise up

becoming too monotonous.

Between the Hills~
Rock-covered hills rise to both the north and south, blocking any view in
those directions, and casting distinct shadows across the ground between the
hills.  The ground here is fairly even, with only the cracked and baked
ground detracting from the smooth and unremarkable features of the nearby
area.  The ground to the east is far more broken and uneven, while to the
west it gets even more level.

Flat Ground~
Clear horizons span in all directions save for the few scattered low
hills that abound to the east and west.  A few segade and rocks litter the
landscape in the distance, but nowhere nearby.  Nearby there is only the
hard ground that is cracked so badly one almost expects it to bleed from the
wound.  Not even the tough grass can be seen even in the distance, as if
those scattered clumps of leather-like grass could be a consolation from the
barren landscape found here.  Mountain ranges lie far off in the distance to
the north and south, yet one to the northeast is closer than the others.

Scattered Rocks~
Many rocks are scattered nearby.  Some are small, some are huge boulders,
but most are the size of a fist, large enough to trip over if not careful. 
To the east there is nothing remarkable, except that it looks overly barren,
as if the Creator wiped all traces of life from that spot of land.  To the
west, there are a few hills and valleys.  Mountain ranges can be seen very
far off to the north and south, yet one to the northeast is closer than the
others.  The mountains are jagged earthen slabs of brown and gray stone,

not much of a view in any direction.  The upper ground to the east looks a
bit rocky, as the outline of the ridge is rough like there are rocks along
there.  To the west, at the top of the hill, a few segade can be seen
outlining the crest, but nothing else of notice can be seen.

clear enough that almost nothing could be hidden from this vantage point, as
there is not much cover to be found.  To the east and west both the land is

Here the hills seem to have dropped just slightly, providing a shallow
depression, or valley in between them.  To the east and west only the hills
can be seen, but to the north and south, mountain ranges can be seen far off
in the distance.  A few clumps of tough, tall grass have grown here in the
fold between the hills.  The mountains are jagged earthen slabs of brown and

but none close enough to be hunted or stalked.  A few mountain ranges are

A decent view can be had here of the nearby landscape.  The ground is
pretty sparce, and there is not much cover, except for the few segade lying
down in the valley to the west.  Far to the west, a few buttes can be seen
rising from the ground, almost dominating the horizon in that direction.

Valleys and Segade~
There is more sand here than in the surrounding area, as it may have been
blown over the years into this lower ground.  A few segade litter the
landscape, yet there seems to be little of the clumps of tough grass that
are sometimes common.  No animals can be spotted nearby, but this low
vantage point does not allow much of a view, and just about anything could
be beyond the next rise.  Not even the nearby segade are large enough to
hide any but the smallest of creatures.

barring any travel in that direction.  Rocks and segade litter the land in
many shapes and sizes, but a few thorny bushes or twisted, stunted trees dot
the landscape on occassion.  To the west, a large cluster of sheer-sided
buttes rise from the ground as a very noticeable landmark.  Far to the north
and south can be seen distant mountain ranges.

sheer-sided buttes rise from the ground in near monolithic form as the most
recognizable landform near here.  Far to the north and south mountain ranges

Alcair Dal~
Alcair Dal, translated from the Old Tongue as "The Golden Bowl", is the

peace within the desert surrounding the Bowl, similar to the peace of
Rhuidean.  The Aiel gather to the Bowl at the call of the Clan Chiefs, to
discuss matters that concern the people as a whole.  Although shaped much
like a bowl, there is nothing golden about it.  Much like a bowl, Alcair Dal
is almost perfectly round.  The gray walls slope all the way around, except
at the far end, where it curls inward like a breaking wave.  At the far end
of the bowl to the north, there is a ledge where the speakers stand on, and

Alcair Dal~
Alcair Dal, translated from the Old Tongue as "The Golden Bowl", is the
gathering place of the thirteen Clans of the Aiel.  There is a agreement of
peace within the desert surrounding the Bowl, similar to the peace of
Rhuidean.  The Aiel gather to the Bowl at the call of the Clan Chiefs, to
discuss matters that concern the people as a whole.  Although shaped much
like a bowl, there is nothing golden about it.  Much like a bowl, Alcair Dal
is almost perfectly round.  The gray walls slope all the way around, except
at the far end, where it curls inward like a breaking wave.  At the far end
of the bowl to the north, there is a ledge where the speakers stand on, and
their voice can be heard all through the bowl.  The gorge to the south leads
out of Alcair Dal to the gathering.

A Nest in the Thicket~
Here the thicket has been pulled away just enough to expose a nest of
ferrets.  The young are snuggled in, feeling warm and protected in their
nest that is surrounded by the concave rock face and the dense thicket. 
There is an unusually large amount of young here, most likely from several
adult ferrets, as many of the adults come and go, checking on the nest while
they search for food and playthings for their young.

Thorny Bushes~
Thorn bushes surround this area, blocking any easy passage.  There are
disturbing sounds of small animals moving close to the ground and rustling
through the thorn bushes.  Occassionally a hare may pop into view, but there
are other sounds coming from nearby that a hare cannot make.  Some of the
branches rise overhead, blocking out the sunlight, but also holding in the
heat.
