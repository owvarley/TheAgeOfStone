A watchfull archer, Child of the Light~
A watchfull archer~
A archer, adorned in the uniform of the Children stands here, watching carefully
~
Here, casting the odd gaze around this tower is an archer wearing the
uniform of the Children of the light.  He stares out of one of the
arrow-slits ever watchfull, The cloak of this archer bears as usual the
sunburst on its left breast and apart from this is un-adorned.  By his right
side in easy drawing distance lies a full quiver, attached to his leather
belt.  His bow, a large powerfull longbow lies on his other side, his left
side one hand grasping it and the other darting from the bowstring to the
quiver, abscent mindedly.  His hawk eyes take in almost anything that moves
outside of the Fortress and some of what is going on inside the tower.

~
This Child of the Light, adorned with the uniform: cloak, tunic and sword
stands near the entrance of the hallway watching the entrance, he brings a
whole new meaning to the word wary as nothing evades his piercing gaze.  His
cloak's left brest is bare save the sunburst telling those with the
knowledge that he is just a recruit but those that take this as a measure of
his skill would surely pay for the mistake as the child looks extremely
tough and hardened.  His gauntleted hands rest at his waist in easy reaching
distance of his sword, a short, plain weapon with a bronze circular hilt
lacking jewels.

This child of the light stands to attention, guarding the room
~
This man stands here to full attention, stiff as wood.  A white tunic
emblazoned with a sunburst covers his armour.  On his shoulders rests a
pristine white cloak whose left brest bears both a sunburst and a lightning
bolt obviously depicting rank.  From beneath his conical helmet comes a
rigid look, the child watches nothing but sees everyting, like a hawk his
eyes not moving.  At his side lies a simple sword on which one of his hands
rests calmly.

The Children's Paymaster~
A rather jolly looking fellow sits behind this desk going through papers.
~
A large maroon shirt buttoned up the front, over which is a pale white
overcoat are the only pieces of clothing that can be seen on this man
sitting behind the desk here.  He is rather short, hence why seeing the rest
of him is difficult, and his desk is rather high.  Surrounding him are
numerous pieces of paper which he seems to be working through methodically,
reading them over made the odd corrections or crumpling the pages up
entirely.  He has a rather rounded and jolly face and despite his work load
he seems to be smiling to himself, obviously a man that enjoys his line of
work.

A young child of the light stands here, the look of youth filling his
face.  His dress is that to a normal whitecloak with his pristine white
cloak, tunic emblazoned with a sunburst and conical helmet yet on his cloaks
left breast sit lightning bolts detailing us his rank, the rank of
Under-Lieutenant.  His hands lay bare by his side with his gauntlets tucked
behind his sword belt and scabbard, his scabbard occuppied by a rather
flashy curving blade with a bejeweled hilt, obviously his pay is
substantially more than that of a normal soldier but can he use the sword
more effectively with the jewels?

This Child of the Light stands at attention yet watches the area attentively
~
A hardened veteran in the Children, this man knows how to fight.  The
plain scabbard by his side and his gauntled hands are too close together for
comfort.  It seems that he could draw the blade his scabbard holds and be
combat ready at the drop of a finger.  His uniform is typical of the
Children of the Light pure white with golden edges and in pristine
condition.  His breastplate and helmet reflect the light thrown down by the
torches through this corridor.  The man's face looks hardened and
emotionless as he stands to attention surveying the scene carefully.

extremely threatening.  His pure white cloak embroidered with both a flaring
sunburst and two silver lightning bolts marks him an officer, of high rank
at that.  His mail and tunic are both in pristine condition, not a mark or
speck of dust marrs them.  His sword, a large broadsword rests by his side,
eager to be put to a use..  His face is hard and bares a long scar running
from his right eye to just below his jaw, obviously this man is no recruit
but quite the opposite judging from his looks and posture.

Sitting here on a stool the Jailor attempts to fight off sleep
~
The jailor is a blocky fellow with a rather large stomach and pudgy
features.  His face is rather smooth with a hooked nose and wiry grin.  His
eyes are of a deep brown and his mop of tousled brown hair seems to frame
his brown eyed countenance.  He sits on a stool fighting an epic battle
against sleep, it looks like he is loosing..

The stable master, Terin Kelaon~
A burly stable master stands here, Terin Kelaon
~
Standing here, near his desc Terin Kelaon is dusting dirt from his coat. 
Holding himself and his job highly, Terin makes a brilliant Stable Master,
almost all the Children know him, eagerly assigning mounts or stabling
others.  His services are offered to all that walk in the light.  His face
is rough and has seen the years, with a few graying hairs amoung his
remaining hair and a full grown bear, speckled with gray hair.  The gray
seems to compliment the black colour of his original hair.  His brown eyes
although plain sparkle when he works, as he enjoys what he does immensly. 
Anytime he is with or around horses he seems to be the happiest, loving
them, tendering them and looking after them, everything a stable master must
do.

Secretary man, child~
A lanky secretary~
Sitting behind the desk, busy with his work is the High Inquisitor's secretary.
~
This man sitting behind a desk piled high with paper and various other
items seems to have a lot on his hands.  Being the secretary of such an
important man would never be an easy job but this men seems to be coping
rather well considering that the pile on his desk does seem to decrease.  He
is of rather a big build, not muscular and not fat with sandy brown hair
that flops about on his forehead, his iron rimmed glasses sit on the edge of
his nose, and he peers through them reading the endless papers on his desk.

This Child of the Light, adorned with the uniform: cloak, tunic and sword
stands near the entrance of the hallway watching the entrance, he brings a
whole new meaning to the word wary as nothing evades his piercing gaze.  His
cloak's left brest is bare save the sunburst telling those with the
knowledge that he is just a recruit but those that take this as a measure of
his skill would surely pay for the mistake as the child looks extremely
tough and hardened.  His gauntleted hands rest at his waist in easy reaching
distance of his sword, a short, plain weapon with a bronze circular hilt
lacking jewels.

This child of the light stands proudly before one of the greatest sights
in the entire fortress, the Dome of Truth.  He stands before it, checking
those that pass into the dome, prevent those not of the Children and making
sure none that enter carry weapons as it is forbidden.  He is suited as the
rest of the children in the Fortress' stone halls, wearing gleaming breast
plate over a pure white tunic with the sunburst on it.  Golden knots on his
shoulders mark him an Under-lieutenant, an esteemed member of the Children
of the Light.  His conical helm leaves his face visible, his brown eyes
scanning the rather wide corridor, many Children come here and many others
are turned away but this man's job is no easy task, taking weapons from
people without causing trouble requires a great deal of skill and diplomacy.
His heavy set build may help him look intimidating but his waist lays bear
lacking weapon maybe he is more effective without a weapon who can tell?

This Inquisitor stratches at his chin, attempting as it seems to scratch
a beard that at present is just a growth.  He looks young, too young to be
an Inquisitor as his uniform depicts, maybe he is older than he seems or
maybe the Hand recruits young, training boys to become tools for digging out
the truth.  The pure white robe the boy wears is marred only by a blood red
Shepard's crook in its left brest, the crook is framed by a blazing
subburst, the insignia of the Children of the Light.  Suprisingly, the ma is
armed, a short bladed sword lies at his waist with a red covered hilt.

Flowing through Form after form after form this practicing Lord Captain must be a blademaster
~
Heron wading in the rushes flows to The Moon Rises Over the Lakes lunging
at an imaginary target, next comes Unfolding of the Fan into Striking the
Spark then back to Heron Spreads Its Wings darting backwards, left right and
forwards.  The man's blade is a blur now moving through Stones Falling Down
the Mountain to The Wind and the Rain through Boar Rushes Downhill then
Thistledown Floats on the Whirlwind it doesnt end.  Sweat trickles down this
hardened man's exposed upper torso, it drips down over his extremely
muscular chest and soaks his simple white breeches.  As the Child of the
Light dances from form to form making various attacks against the air he
seems to remain in one spot, beneath this Great oak tree, basking in its
glory.  Hanging over the tree are the man's shirt, tabard and scabbard, his
tunic's telling knots of rank mark him a high ranked Lord Captain.  The
blade in his hand is without doubt heron marked, as it whirls the slightly
sunlight that breaks through the Great Oak glints of it giving a golden
reflection.  The man has long will groomed hair that is, as his breeches,
soaked in sweat, his green eyes dark about as he drifts in the flame and the
void, a more than worthy opponent..

Bending a wicked looking Cat-of-nine tails this Inquisitor stands near two iron rings

The steel-tipped cat-of-nine tails this Inquisitor wields is extremely
lethal, able to dig long and deep gashes out of a victim's back, the shock
causes by the whip also adds to the pain of the victim as their blood flows
freely down their backs.  The Inquisitor seems perfectly calm, simply
standing bending the whip gently, cradling it like a mother cradles a child.
The Inquisitors all believe themselves the Creator's own tool for digging
out the truth using these painfull yet extremely effective methods of
torture to extract the truth, Not a single person arrested by the Hand has
ever been found Innocent or so the rumour goes, Inquisitors know the guilt
of their victims before they torture them, they know whether a person is a
darkfriend or not all the seek is the admittance from the victim.

Arms crossed, this Inquisitor smiles wickedly watching the Juda Cradle
~
This Inquisitor is calmly standing here, near the center of the room arms
crossing each other.  He casually glances at the machine of torture in front
of him, the Juda Cradle, a device created by the Hand of the Light by a Lord
Inquisitor called Eurias Juda.  The machine may be one of the simplest
machines in the torture chamber but its simplicity in no way reflects upon
the amount of pain this device can inflict.  The Inquisitor's job is simple,
attaching the prisoners to the winch and harness, raising them up on it high
above the sharp tipped pyramid then lowering them onto the pyramid.  The
pyramid's sharp top creates hell for the victim as it destroys the area
between their legs causing a great amount of pain and suffering that is
long-term lasting even after the victim is released some times.  This evil
machine is in the carefull hands of a Light guided Inquisitor.

The eastern gate is rather large, tho not as large as the southern gate. 
The gate is not as active as the other two with few people riding into and
out of the Fortress from that side.

stable~
A large building sits to the west, filled with horses, warhorses rather. 
Officers that ride into the fortress dismount and leave their horse to
either the squires dotted around the fortress or another Child of the Light
of a lower rank.  The stables are big, big enough to support the Children of
the Light station here's needs.  
~
E
barr~
The main barracks is of to the west, in the north western corner of the
fortress.  Many Children of the Light go both into and out of the large
building.  Just outside it on a barren plot of land is their practice area
which is always in use.  
~
E
gallow~
Death...  Executions by the gallows in the Fortress are a common sight. 
As many as twenty 'darkfriends' can be and are hung a day, sometimes more
sometimes less.  There is always a guard by the gallows, ready to pull his
lever and send many men to their deaths, some innocent, some not.  The
gallows takes up a small area near to the main stables.  
~
E
cside~
To the south streches a wide area of land stretching for miles.  A short
woodland lies south, far enough to be seen and far enough so as not a pose a
security risk.  The land to the south is rather short, and of a luxious
green color.  The road leading south runs straight as far as the eye can
see.  
~
E
sgate~
The southern gate is one of the largest of the three gates that allow
entrance into the Fortress.  Its guarded heavily and is near enough to the
barracks so that in the case of an emergancy, more men can be pulled into
defence.  The Walls linking the gate run straight like arrows, linking with
small towers to the west and east.  
~
E
dome~
The Dome of Truth, the trial grounds for the Darkfriends and accused. 
The Dome is a wonder, gilded gold with magnificant carvings and colors
covering its low walls and dome.  Many Children enter the dome, tho none
with swords as it is forbidden.  
~
E
fort~
The Fortress of the Light's main building lies just to the north.  It
rises about four floors high and is a spectacle in itself.  Beautifully
carved walls and equally ornate windows, the door itself, the main entrance
is carved and gilded with extreme skill and eloquence.  
~

From any of the four windows, you can see most if not all of the Fortress

tapestry~
This picture depicts quite a horrific scene.  A large wood and metal
scaffold has been raised in the middle of the Inner courtyard of the
Fortress of the Light, Being raised on the scaffolding is a limp body, a
body belonging to none other than Serenia Latar, a once time Amyrlin Seat of
the Whitetower.  The crowds packed in arrounding the scaffold are jubilant,
shouting and cheering and throwing rotten vegetables at the Amyrlin, the
only Amyrlin ever hanged by the Children of the Light.  The body being
hanged was dead of course, as hanging a live witch can prove to be quite a
task.  This incident took place more than 600 years ago, around that time
justice was done according to the law.

tapestry~
This large tapestry depicts a scene from a long time ago, during the
Hundred Years War.  The scene is depicting a clear night near a place called
Moisen.  Two large armies battle for the field, dead and wounded cover the
field almost more dead and wounded then fighting, more and more men pour
over the hills into the bloody fray of death and chaos, both General's dead
both armies in disarray trying to fight a way through each other, knowing
that for each man they loose their chances of surving to get back home
diminish, a fruitless battle, fought not over land or titles but fought by
shear bad commanding.  A bloody, battle.  A battle worth forgotten.

The back of a peacefull study hall~
This hall is rather expansive and is used by both members of the Hand
and those aspiring to join the Hand.  There are numerous tables each of
which can seat four people around them and there is enough surface space on
the tables to hold plenty of books and documents as the case may require. 
There is a collection of chairs not around tables that are used simply for
light reading or resting depending on the person occupying it.  The room is
decorated in a crimson red color, its stonewalls are still white but
decorated with crimson silk runners or hanging bolts of material dyed red. 
As with most rooms in this corridor, a large banner hangs from the back of
the room that of the Shepard's crook, colored a deep red.  As well as the
flag there is also a large hanging, depicting an artists impression of the
Fortress of the Light.

Along a stone hallway~
This well lit hallway is the linking corridor between the offices of the
Lord Captain command and the High Inquisitor and the glorious dome of truth,
located to the south.  At regular intervals along the hallway, wall
decorations have been mounted to live up the otherwise drab stonewalls. 
Natural light can beam in through the stained glass windows that are set
high up, above in the hallway they are the main source of light.  At night,
the wall-mounted lanterns throw down enough light to brighten up the
corridor.  The lanterns light dances off of the windows and throws down
dancing rays of light that move as gracefully as a battle-hardened warder. 
A beautifully crafted staircase is also situated off this hallway, a
staircase which sees frequent use as it is the only staircase leading up to
this floor.  The staircase leads down to the floors below.  The hallway here
is usually busy with Children of the Light bustling along to stare in awe
and the glorious sight of the heart of the Children of the Light, the Dome
of Truth.  The hallway continues closing on the Dome of Truth, while back to
the north lies the staircase and main hallway.

beyond.

A long stone corridor~
This rather plain stone corridor acts as the main link between all the
quarters and offices allocated on this floor and the other floors of the
Fortress both above and below this floor.  The main usage for the Third
floor of the Fortress is as a collection of Offices and Quarters set aside
for high ranked offices who are assigned to the Fortress of the Light.  The
main meeting chambers for the Council of Anointed also reside on these
floors; the chambers are used for meetings when the Dome of the light or the
Lord Captain Commanders private room is not suitable for a meeting.  Some of
the members of the Council of Anointed have quarters and offices on this
floor.  The walls of this corridor have been decorated with tapestries of
the Children of the light as well as Pennants and Banners to help make the
otherwise plain and boring looking stone walls look slightly more
interesting and eye warming.  The presence of Guards on this floor is barely
noticeable; there don't seem to be any walking the corridors though the
crossed blades over one the door ways on this floor do point out that there
is a guard station on this floor.  The corridor here splits in various
directions, to the south it leads deeper into the floor, passing various
officers and quarters on its journey.  To the north, nearby, there is a
large staircase which allows access to both the higher and lower floors of
the Fortress.  To the west, the corridor leads through this floor passing
important areas such as the Chambers of the Council of Anointed and various
other quarters.

Along a stone corridor~
This rather plain stone corridor acts as the main link between all the
quarters and offices allocated on this floor and the other floors of the
Fortress both above and below this floor.  The main usage for the Third
floor of the Fortress is as a collection of Offices and Quarters set aside
for high ranked offices who are assigned to the Fortress of the Light.  The
main meeting chambers for the Council of Anointed also reside on these
floors; the chambers are used for meetings when the Dome of the light or the
Lord Captain Commanders private room is not suitable for a meeting.  Some of
the members of the Council of Anointed have quarters and offices on this
floor.  The walls of this corridor have been decorated with tapestries of
the Children of the light as well as Pennants and Banners to help make the
otherwise plain and boring looking stone walls look slightly more
interesting and eye warming.  The presence of Guards on this floor is barely
noticeable; there don't seem to be any walking the corridors though the
crossed blades over one the door ways on this floor do point out that there
is a guard station on this floor.  The door to the north is rather elaborate
in design, such a door would only be used for the Highest of ranked officers
in the Children, such must be the door to then north.  It leads into a very
large and luxurious set of quarters which many seldom are allowed into.  The
corridor continues here to the west and east.

leads into what seems to be a plush set of quarters belonging to a High
Ranking officer in the Children of the Light.  Other than there door there
are few decorations here in the hallway as it leads west and east, west
towards one of the staircases and an intersection and east, continuing
through the floor.

various offices as it continues along its path.  To the south the corridor
leads towards a staircase.

The corridor here is a small break off of the main corridor of the Third
floor of the Fortress, it is rather short and only leads just to the south
where the staircase itself sits.  This another staircase located on this
floor back to the north-east quite some distance away, both allow access to
the higher floors of the Fortress.  The walls of this corridor have been
decorated with tapestries of the Children of the light as well as Pennants

A staircase~
The staircase here leads upwards to the fourth floor of the Fortress. 
The staircase itself is rather simple in design, it allows access for a
large number of people at the same time, such is required due to the large
number of people who need to reach the top floors of the Fortress.  The
walls of the staircase here are made of the same material as the hallway
which passes by the staircase to the south; smooth and rather plain white
stone.  There are few decorations around the staircase although a
brilliantly entwined runner of yellow and white silk curls its way up the
hand railings of the staircase like some sort of Amadacian serpent only
existing in myth.  The corridor to the north leads back onto the main
corridor of the Third floor of the Fortress of the light.

A small officer's quarters~
These quarters are rather small compared to some of the other rooms on
this floor, this room must be assigned to an Officer with perhaps a
temporary roll in the Children and one who most probably has another set of
quarters elsewhere.  The room holds the bare necessities of what is required
by an Officer in order to get some rest and keep themselves looking on top
form.  The room consists of a bed lined against the northern wall; it sits
next to a rather tall dark panelled wooden cupboard.  There is also a small
desk and chair placed just at the foot of the bed to allow the occupant of
this room to do some work.  As well as this, behind the door there sits a
small wash basin complete with towels and other washing materials.  The wash
basin has been placed on top of a small, low down cupboard which can hold
various items.  Above the basin there is a mirror with small shelves
surrounding it for holding various shaving implements.  The door to the east
leads back, out of this rather small set of quarters, back onto the main
corridor of the Third Floor.

Another set of quarters suited for an officer~
These quarters have been designed to suit the needs of an Officer who has
been assigned to the Fortress of the Light on a temporary basis.  The room
is made up of a small desk fitted against the southern wall, the desk
adjoins to a small cupboard which has been setup as a wash basin of some
sort, there is a small mirror mounted on the wall directly above the wash
basin.  In the north eastern corner of the room there is a rather tall and
wide cupboard for storing clothes or other items such as armour.  Beside the
cupboard, lining the western wall is the small bed for this set of Quarters.
Above the head of the bed on the northern wall there has been mounted
another shelving unit to store literature or paper work on, there is also a
small hand lantern in case it is needed.  There are two pegs on the eastern
wall, these pegs can be used to hang a variety of items from sword belts to
tabards.  The door to the west leads out of this room and back onto the main
corridor of the Third floor of the Fortress of the Light.

A set of exquisite quarters, suited only for a high ranking officer~
These quarters have been carefully and cleverly designed to fit the every
need of a ranked officer in the Children of the Light.  These area here acts
as the link between this room and the rest of the quarters consisting of a
large bedroom, study and quiet room.  The room has been carefully decorated
to the likings and standards of the owner of the room, using a large range
of decorations ranging from tapestries to gleaming metallic shields and
various strips of colourful material.  There are two sets of doors here in
the room, one to the east and one to the south, the eastern door leads into
what must be the study of the quarters while the southern one leads out of
these quarters, back onto the corridor of this floor.  To the north is the
quiet area of these quarters, set aside for relaxing, or other such
activities.

A quiet room~
This room is set up as a sitting room for the quarters, lush couches and
chairs have been set up allowing anyone to have a seat and to relax after
perhaps a long days work or long night watch.  The chairs have been set up
surrounding a large, low down table in place to hold various mugs or glasses
used by those occupying the chairs.  The light for the room is thrown down
of the gold leaf lanterns mounted high up on the white stone walls of these
quarters.  These stone walls are rather boring and the owner of these
quarters has done his best to make them more exciting and lively, adding a
gleaming shield bearing the sunburst of the Children of the Light and
various tapestries to the walls.  The door to the east leads into the closed
and quiet bed chamber of these quarters while to the south lies the entrance
hall and beyond the door there, the main corridor of the Third Floor of the
Fortress.

A large study~
This study has been cut of from the rest of the quarters so that the
officer who owns these quarters can work quietly and without being
disturbed.  The furniture of the study consists of; A large wooden desk, an
extremely comfortable looking chair, bookcase and filling cabinet.  The
owner of these quarters must be a tactictioner of some sort as the desk has
been carefully positioned so that it faces both the doors that lead into the
room, meaning that the Officer can see anyone who tries to enter his study. 
Above the door to the west are two crossed swords, both are magnificently
crafted from some of the finest steel known to man, the value of these
weapons must be incredible, something only a ranked officer in the Children
could afford.  The door to the west leads back into the main entrance hall
for these quarters while the door to the north leads into the bedchambers of
these quarters.

The quarters' bedchamber~
The bedchambers to these quarters are just a posh and plush as the rest
of the rooms, the design of them has been carefully and delicately designed
to the tastes of the owner of the rooms, from the amount of care put into
designing this room and quarters, the owner is perhaps a more permanent
fixture at the Fortress.  The bedchamber consists of a large amount of
ornate furniture ranging from four posted beds to luxurious reclining
chairs.  There are also some chests of drawers around the room, set in place
to store the various clothes of the owner.  As well as the furniture,
mounted along the walls of this room there are various golden leaf lamps
used to illuminate the chambers.  There seems to be a faint and warming
smell hanging in the air, some sort of Illianer Perfume, or something else,
rare, expensive and exotic.  The door to the south leads into the study
while the door to the west leads into the quiet sitting room area of these
quarters.

A plush set of rooms~
These rooms are rather well kept and designed with expensive and rare
materials.  These area here has been set aside as a sitting area and study
for the room.  The desk that sits in the corner of the room seems as if it
has been crafted from one single piece of wood, this makes it obvious that
the desk is made from the expensive and rare Sung Wood.  Other than the
desk, there are various relaxing or lounging chairs spaced out through the
room, providing a comfortable place to sit or to rest.  The light for the
room is thrown down from various lanterns mounted high on the walls.  Other
than the lanterns, the white stone walls have been decorated with large
tapestries and various drapes of colourful and expensive material.  There is
a door to both the north and south, the door to the south seems to lead out
of the room, back onto the main corridor of this floor of the Fortress,
while the door to the north leads into the lavish sleeping area of these
officer's quarters.

The sleeping area of the room~
This bedroom is equally as stylish and plush as the quiet sitting room
and study which lies to south though the door way.  There is a large bed
situated along the centre of the northern wall, the bed seems to be made
from some rare dark-reddish wood and is covered with thick covers of a
scarlet colour.  Other than the bed there are also various chest of drawers
and dressers surrounding the walls of the room allowing places for the
Officer who is lucky enough to have been assigned this room a place to store
his belongings be it clothes, armour, weaponry or even spare bedding for the
luxurious wooden bed.  The white stone walls of the room have been
brightened and decorated using a dark red and white colour scheme, various
tapestries and patterned cloth have been mounted on the wall along with a
wicked slightly curving longsword, mounted in its ornate scabbard, a sword
definitely reserved for the most special occasions only.  The door to the
south leads out of the bedchamber and back into the main entrance area.

A small office~
This small office has been set up just of the main corridor of the Third
Floor of the Fortress of the Light.  The office has been well furnished with
a large l-shaped desk dominating the corner of the room along with a large,
high backed chair placed carefully behind the desk.  Behind the desk and
chair sits a small shelf to hold the books and parchments belonging to the
owner of this Office.  The walls have been decorated with various emblems of
the Children of the Light ranging from blazing sunburst to yellow and white
runners of silk.  The owner of the desk has had his name and rank set into a
bronze plaque which sits on the front of the desk.  Other than the plaque
the top of the desk is relatively clear with only a small stack of
parchments cluttering it up.  The door to the south leads out of this office
and back onto the main corridor.

A reception area~
This area has been setup as a reception for the office which sits to the
east through the doorway.  Here there is a small desk set in the corner of
the room complete with high backed chair and a similarly small filling
cabinet.  The array of furniture manages to be neatly tucked in beside the
doorway without blocking access to the room next door.  As well as the desk
and other furniture set aside for the receptionists use there is a long
bench set against the northern wall to allow people to wait without having
to stand up for a long period of time.  The walls of the room have been
decorated heavily in an attempt to liven up the otherwise dull and cold
white stone walls.  The decorations consists mainly of large and colourful
tapestries as well as a few wall mounted lanterns used to light the room. 
The door to the east leads on through into the office of this Office while
the door to the west leads back, out of the office, onto the corridor of the
Third Floor.

The study of this office~
The study here is rather expansive but most of the space is taken up by
the immense desk which partially blocks access to the bookcase and cabinet
which sit behind the desk.  The chair, in comparison to the desk is not very
large, but it looks extremely comfortable and inviting.  The chair behind
the desk is not the only one present in the room as there are also a pair of
chairs sitting on the door side of the desk to allow those who come in to
see who ever owns this office to have a place to sit while they talk or are
talked to.  Behind the desk, framed with a golden coloured and intricate
frame, is a large torn and tattered but still distinguishable banner, the
Banner of the Children of the Light, perhaps some memento from a war or
engagement from long ago.  The door to the west leads back out of this study
into the reception area of this office.

A large office~
This large office has various areas where Officers in the Children of the
Light can go about the paper work of interview work they may need to carry
out as part of their role in the Children.  There are two main office areas,
one to the south which seems to be made up of various numbers of desks and
chairs, and one to the east which seems to just be assigned to one officer
and is rather large compared to the area to the south.  The office has been
carefully and critically decorated, the plain walls have been livened up
using various emblems of the Children of the Light, ranging from Pennants to
Tapestries and even Steel shields bearing the sunburst of the Children. 
Other than the offices to the east and south there is a small resting area
hidden out of sight from here, in the entrance of the office, but the area
sits behind both the offices roughly to the south-east.  The large door back
to the west leads out of this office, back onto the main corridor of the
Third floor of the Fortress.

A large study~
This large room has been set aside for the sole use of one Officer in the
Children of the Light; it seems to be that the owner of this office is in
charge of the other Officers who work in this office, at the work stations
to the south-west.  The study here is made up of the usually arrangement of
desk, chair, shelf unit and filling cabinet.  There is one item in this room
which seems to distinguish it from the rest of similar studies or offices in
the building, this is the fireplace built into the northern wall.  The
mantle place of the fireplace has been expertly crafted out of blue-veined
marble.  It really adds to the countenance of the room, immediately making
it less dull and boring.  Other than the fireplace there are also various
weapons mounted on the walls, ranging from broadswords to throwing axes,
there even seems to be a sort of short Polearm with a blade on the top half.
There are two exits from this study, one to the west which leads back into
the entrance area of this office and one to the south which leads into a
small resting area set aside for the Officers who work in this office.

A small resting area~
This area has been furnished carefully with various couches and
reclining chairs, the main use of this room obviously being to relax and
take it easy while not working or perhaps to have a work related
conversation in a more relaxing Environment.  The chairs all look extremely
comfortable and inviting, as well as the array of furniture there is also a
table set roughly in the centre of the chairs on which Officers of occupants
of this room can place various mugs or glasses.  The room has been decorated
with comfort in mind, light, soothing colours have been chosen for the
materials mounted on the walls as well as the silk runners lining the top of
the white, stone walls.  There are two doors boarding this room, one to the
west and one to the north, the door to the west leads into a work station
area set aside for various officers to get some work done, while the door to
the north leads into a single study, set aside for the Officer in charge of
this Office area.

An area of 'Work-stations'~
This area of the office has been set aside for use by from about one to
four officers in the Children of the Light.  Four similar desks have been
carefully arranged in the room to allow each officer equal space in which to
work.  Each desk has a high-backed chair behind it and the desk has, built
into it, a large number of drawers for storing papers or writing materials. 
Each of the Corners of the room are occupied by one of these 'work-stations'
it seems to be that this method works well in offices where Officers must
work together in order to complete a specific task as being all in the same
office makes co-ordination a lot easier.  The presence of the Children of
the Light is made obvious in this room by the large sunburst that has been
set into the floor directly in the middle of all the work stations, along
the walls there are also, at regular intervals runners of yellow silk which
run from the top of the stone wall to the bottom, brightening up the room. 
The door to the north leads back into the main entrance room for these
Offices while the one to the east leads into the small resting area of these
offices.

The entrance to this set of quarters~
Shadows dance across the walls of the room, reflecting off of shiny
surfaces such as the mirror or the metal on the sofa, the lantern that casts
down this light is positioned high up in the room so it can, by itself, cast
down enough light to illuminate the entire room.  Directly under the lamp's
light, a circle of furniture rests, forming a semi-circle around a small
coffee table on which there are various books and manuscripts, as well as
the books there is a small gaming board on which is set out a game of fox
and hounds.  The furniture faces the open hearth of a fire, which is
currently unlit.  As well as the chairs and sofa there is a large cabinet
with a glass face, in the cabinet there are some more books, a stones gaming
board and a pack of Amadacian playing cards.  The room has a strong smell of
tabac, the half full pipe sitting on the table obviously is the reason for
this, the room seems to have a relaxed and rather calm air about it.  There
are only two doors leading into or out of this room, one leading evidently
into the bed chamber of the room while the other returns to the main
hallway.

A member of the Council of Anointed's chambers~
Two gold leaf lamps light this bedchamber, both are situated opposite
each other, mounted on the wall.  As well as the mounted lamps there is
another lamp on the bedside table, although unlit it is almost identical to
the other two lamps.  The bed of the chamber is quite something, it is a
very large four-poster bed with blue and white bedding and a variety of
different shaped and sized pillows at the head of it.  Draped from poster to
poster is a long thing sheet of material, the material is not opaque as on
looking carefully the inside of the bed can be seen, it adds a little extra
protection from the light cast down by the lamps.  Beside the bed and
bedside table there is a dressing table and a screen hiding a large copper
bath behind it, these types of baths are common throughout the Fortress as
many children enjoy a nice relaxing bath after a long hard days work, or a
particularly long duty on the watch.  The dressing table is made entirely of
wood and on its surface there is a rather tall yet not wide mirror mounted
on it.  The dresser has many drawers for storing clothing or other personal
items that need to be kept somewhere safe.  The only door in this room leads
back to the reception room.

The meeting chamber's for the Council of the Anointed~
This rather large chamber is the home to meetings of the Council of
Anointed, the council that heads and runs the Children of the Light.  The
chamber is of an extortionate design, not surprising considering the amount
of grandeur the designers of the Fortress of the Light seem to have put into
various other parts of the Fortress, the walls are a perfect white marble,
un-tainted and clean to the point that it sparkles.  Four pillars stand
guard over the chamber's elaborately carved and sculptured roof, each pillar
is an equal distance apart from each other, adding to their splendor. 
Snaking its way around the marble pillar and making its way upwards is a
span of golden silk sparkling brightly, each of the pillars in the hall are
decorated identically, the only difference being the carvings on the arch
base at the top of the pillar.  Further into the hall is the head of the
Council's desk where the meetings that take place here are set out.  On
either side of the desk, to the west and to the east, are rows of other,
smaller desks, each row on a different level.  The other members of the
Council of Anointed sitting in on meetings use these desks to put forward
their view of opinions.

Seating for the Council of Anointed~
Here, on this far side of the room, arranged neatly are many desks with
chairs, provided for members of the Council of Anointed that are present
during one of their meetings.  The ground is stepped so that each row of
desks is at a different level to the next giving each person a clear view of
the head of the Council's desk.  In the center of the assembled chairs is a
tall and ornate pillar made out of white marble, it breaks up the otherwise
identical rows of desks adding a touch of variation to the room's
appearance.  The floor is, as the pillar, made from white marble with light
blue veins crossing it at numerous points.  Snaking its way around the

Here at the far end of the hall for meetings within the council of

of Anointed and at the desk the meetings of the Council are planned out and
carried out by the Head of the Council.  The chamber is of an extortionate

The entrance to a plush room~
This is the entry room of this rather large set of apartments.  The
furniture in this room is rather simple consisting of a few chairs for
relaxing in and a long, cushioned sofa made for two to three people.  The
room is rather well decorated, with different colored material drooped over
the lamps lighting the room as well as a touch of red here of there,
brightening up the otherwise dull yellow stonewalls.  A small wooden shelf
of books is mounted on the far wall, home to various old novels and history
books.  The collection of furniture form a rough circle and in the center of
the circle is a small and low down table on which various bits of paper
reside as well as a stones board whose pieces are already set up indicating
that a game must still be being played.  There are three doors leading both
into and out of this room.  One leads into the apartment's large bedchamber,
the other one leads into the private study of the quarters and the final one
leads into and out of the room.

A member of the council of Anoited's chambers~
This bed chamber is rather extensive and also exquisite, the bed is no
simple bed, in fact far from it, it is made from the finest of dark paneled
oak and its four posters are draped with white and red silk that cover the
sides of the bed.  The bed is very large maybe a king or queen size, and its
mattress is extremely soft and accommodating not to mention springy, making
it everything anyone would want in a bed.  The two lanterns that light the
room dance shadows across the walls as they flicker and giving a marvelous
effect when they dance across the silk draped over the bed.  As well as a
bed, there is also a dressing table with a rather tall mirror, the dressing
table has various drawers of different sizes for holding a variety of
objects.  Beside the dressing table is a set of drawers holding clothes for
the occupants of the room.  A wonderful scented smell seems to waft through
the room emanating from a large copper bath, which is half hidden behind a
screen, next to the copper bath is a large jug used for filling it.  The
door in the room leads back into the reception area of the room.

A study room for this member of the council~
This study is rather small compared to the rest of the rooms I this
apartment.  Although small this room is more than adequate for the needs of
its occupants.  A large flat desk, facing the door, takes up the majority of
the room, its wooden front intricately carved into various patterns and
designs.  Behind the desk sits a comfortable looking chair, cushioned with
red and white pillows providing the maximum soothing possible.  As well as
the desk, there is a large set of shelves standing behind it, whose shelves
hold many books and manuscripts on various subjects and topics.  The shelf
is well cleaned, and being made from soft wood, it gives of a light pine
smell.  The air here is most pleasingly calm, the perfect atmosphere to have
in ones office where, without interruption lots of work can be done quickly
and efficiently.

A large room~
This large room has been set aside as a sitting area and entrance hall. 
This seems to be a common design in quarters of this side, they usually have
the entrance area designed as a sitting area and the other room, closed by a
door as a sleeping or study area, this is the case here as to the north
there is a large door which leads into the sleeping chambers for this room,
in the sleeping chambers there is also a small study.  The room here has
various emblems of the Children of the Light, the owner being a true
follower and believer.  Various pennants and flags have been mounted on the
walls and there is also a draped piece of white cloth bearing the blazing
sunburst of the children dominating the western wall.  The chairs in the
sitting area all seem to be collaborated around a small table, the table is
littered with Literature of the Children of the Light, one of the books was
even written by the creator of the Children of the Light, back when the
Children were a group of preachers against the rise of the Shadow.  The door
to the south leads out of this room and back onto the corridor while to the
north the door leads into the bedchamber.

The sleeping area of these chambers have been carefully decorated using
only the colours of the Children of the Light, deep yellows have been used
along with plain whites and bright silvers.  The result is a beautifully
decorated and truly patriotic room devoted to the Children.  The walls are
decorated with Battle Tapestries depicting scenes of great glory in the
Children of the Light.  The room is used half as a bed room and half as a
study as besides the large bit sitting against the northern wall there is an
equally large desk and bookcase which dominates the eastern wall.  There are
also various other pieces of furniture which make the room into a proper bed
chamber, including items such as a dressing table and a large chest of
drawers for clothes or armour.  There is a large wooden trunk set at the end
of the bed, used to store personal belongings which need to be kept safe
obviously.  The door to the south leads back into the entrance hall and
sitting area of these devoted quarters.

The inner courtyard begins~
This vast area of land which is bordered by various buildings and at
some points stone circular walls is know through out the Fortress of the
Light as the Inner courtyard.  In the Fortress of the Light there are two
main courtyards, the first is the Outer courtyard, the area at the entrance
of the Fortress, the second is this area, the area beyond the Inner gate. 
Both courtyards are surrounded by perimeter walls, walls, which form a
circular pattern within which the courtyards are laid out.  Traffic in this
courtyard is light, light compared to that that traverses the other
courtyard, the traffic here is purely people, no wagons or carts just
people.  Many of the people of members of the Children of the Light but an
equal number are not, these other people come from a wide range of people,
those looking to join the Children, Nobles requesting audiences with the
Council of Anointed or even some times the Children's servants wearing white
and gold livery.  These people move through the Inner courtyard, heading
towards many of the buildings located here.  On the eastern side of the
courtyard rests the North Barracks and just to the south of that the Guests
Quarters, the main stable of this courtyard is strategically placed next to
the Inner gate on the southern side.  To the west beyond the stable are the
notorious Gallows and the equally famed Gate of Bereavement from which
sentenced Followers of the Dark are brought out to meet the creator.  The
pinnacle of the Inner courtyard is the building that resides to the east of
the Gardens on the north side of the courtyard.  The Fortress of the Light,
the Bastion of the Light the name matters not but its great ambience does,
its perfectly smooth stone walls with specs of marble laced intermittently
through out are stunning, it is quite a work off art.  Even more astounding
than the main building is what lies on top of it, the Famed Dome of Truth,
heart of the Children of the Light, center of its power and justice, its
gold leaf exterior just visible from here in the Inner courtyard.

Along the stable~
To the west, here resides the Inner courtyard's stable wall.  The wall is
made from soft stone carefully cut and placed to construct a rather tall
building.  The wall still looks new, with only a little bit of erosion
visible around the edges of the stones.  The entrance to the stable is a
break in the wall to the north, a pair of wide doors lie open at the
entrance allowing free flow of people both into and out of the Stable.  The
notorious stenches associated with stables pervade this room, stale straw
mixed with manure, not a pleasant smell, but a smell that can be easily
ignored by working with animals and being subjected to it.  The rest of the
Inner courtyard continues around this stable building flowing in its many
directions leading to the many buildings that line its borders.  Traffic
flows gently through the Inner courtyard traffic being light only, people
and mounted men no wagons or carts of any sort.  The majority of mounted men
ride over to the stables to stable their mounts while they deal with their
business in the Fortress.

Before a gatehouse of the inner gate~
Just to the south from here is one of the Inner Gate's guardhouses.  It
is well maintained by the Children that are assigned to it, always being
kept neat and tidy, weapons on the racks, heavy chairs round the table in
the center.  It projects the perfect image of the Children of the Light,
neat and aware of their surroundings.  However, this is but one mere face of
the many that the Children portray.  The gatehouse is a tall building,
stretching up to the upper part of the gate where in the portcullis resides.
Within the gatehouse there is a wide ladder, made from wood, which leads
upwards through a trapdoor, the ladder leads into the upper floor of the
gatehouse, where another group of guards stand watch, maybe even some
archers.  In the Fortress of the Light there are two main courtyards, the
first is the Outer courtyard, the area at the entrance of the Fortress, the
second is this area, the area beyond the Inner gate.  Both courtyards are
surrounded by perimeter walls, walls, which form a circular pattern within
which the courtyards are laid out.  Traffic in this courtyard is light, few
people flo through the Inner gate located to the southwest.  It is light
compared to that that traverses the other courtyard, the traffic here is
purely people, no wagons or carts just people.  Further north beyond the
Guests Quarters entrance is the North barracks and its entrance.  To the
west beyond the stable are the notorious Gallows and the equally famed Gate

Along the wall of the guest quarters, in the inner courtyard~
The Inner courtyard continues in all directions, it passes here, along a
stonewall, the western wall of the Guests Quarters that is located to the
east.  The wall is, like most of the buildings here, smooth to the touch and
cool as it is, for the majority of the day, shaded from the sun by its tall
walls.  The Guest Quarters sole exit lies to the north from here, it is a
tall pair of ornate doors, doors with enough headroom for even the tallest
of Ogier.  The rest of the Inner courtyard leads off in its various

Before the guest quarters~
Here directly before the Guests Quarters entrance to the east the true
face of the Guests Quarters comes to surface.  Seeing past the large ornate
pairs of doors and its pair of armed guards that stand watch over it one can
see a long corridor lined with heavy doors.  Each door is fitted with a
lock, the ring of keys attached to the belt of the older of the two guards
at the entrance obviously locks or unlocks each of them.  This is more of a
posh cellblock than an actual set of quarters, the Children of the Light
being able to lock and secure all the guests in their rooms whenever they
need and open when they need.  In the Fortress of the Light there are two
main courtyards, the first is the Outer courtyard, the area at the entrance
of the Fortress, the second is this area, the area beyond the Inner gate.

Towards an entrance to the barracks~
The Guests Quarters wall ends here and just as it ends the North Barracks
western wall begins but they are not linked.  There is due to the
positioning of the two walls a small gap created between the walls.  The gap
seems to serve no purpose as the only visible items in it is a long thin
gutter drain that snakes down the wall of the Guests Quarters and stops just
above an indented grate.  A grate that most probably leads into the drainage
system of the sewage system or even both.  The rest of the Inner courtyard
leads off in its various directions.  In the Fortress of the Light there are
two main courtyards, the first is the Outer courtyard, the area at the

Small gap between the Guest Quarters and the Northern Barracks~
This small space between the two towering buildings ends in a solid wall,
a wall that links the Barracks with the Guest Quarters.  A long, thin gutter
runs down the wall of the Guest Quarters, ending just above the ground,
positioned below it is a metal grate, obviously leading into the drainage
system of the Fortress.  A slightly foul odor seems to pervade this little
area, maybe that grate leads to the sewers and not to the drainage system or
maybe even here in the Fortress both are together as one.  The majority of
the courtyard is cut off from view here by the two towering walls of the
Barracks and the Guest Quarters, the only visible sight is the far western
side of the courtyard where The Gallows and Gate of Bereavement are sited. 
As well as this, the top of the main stable is just about visible from here.
The only exit is the way into this gap between the buildings, back to the
west emerging into the busy Inner courtyard.

Along the barracks wall~
This wall to the east is part of the western wall of the North Barracks,
it is made of smooth stone and it shines brightly due to the sun's rays that
sometimes are reflected onto the wall.  The entrance to the North Barracks
stands to the north, the entrance being one of the four that lead into and
out of the Barracks.  This entrance and exit is a great pair of doors, both
joined together creating an extremely wide exit, it needs to be large so the
great number of Children stationed in the Barracks can move into and out of
it quickly and efficiently.  The Inner courtyard continues, surrounding this
area as it moves in all directions.  In the Fortress of the Light there are
two main courtyards, the first is the Outer courtyard, the area at the
entrance of the Fortress, the second is this area, the area beyond the Inner
gate.  Both courtyards are surrounded by perimeter walls, walls, which form
a circular pattern within which the courtyards are laid out.  Traffic in
this courtyard is light, few people flow through the Inner gate located to

courtyard, the traffic here is purely people, no wagons or carts just
people.  Further north beyond the Guests Quarters entrance is the North
barracks and its entrance.  To the west beyond the stable are the notorious
Gallows and the equally famed Gate of Bereavement from which sentenced
Followers of the Dark are brought out to meet the creator.  The pinnacle of
the Inner courtyard is the building that resides to the east of the Gardens
on the north side of the courtyard.  The Fortress of the Light, the Bastion
of the Light the name matters not but its great ambience does, its perfectly
smooth stone walls with specs of marble laced intermittently through out are
stunning, it is quite a work off art.  Even more astounding than the main
building is what lies on top of it, the Famed Dome of Truth, heart of the
Children of the Light, center of its power and justice, its gold leaf
exterior just visible from here in the Inner courtyard.

Before the entrance to the barracks~
The great doors leading into the North Barracks sit here to the east.  In
the Fortress of the Light there are two main courtyards, the first is the
Outer courtyard, the area at the entrance of the Fortress, the second is
this area, the area beyond the Inner gate.  Both courtyards are surrounded
by perimeter walls, walls, which form a circular pattern within which the
courtyards are laid out.  Traffic in this courtyard is light, few people
flow through the Inner gate located to the southwest.  It is light compared
to that that traverses the other courtyard, the traffic here is purely
people, no wagons or carts just people.  Further north beyond the Guests
Quarters entrance is the North barracks and its entrance.  To the west

E
doors~
There are two doors both extremely wide and tall allowing a great volume
of people both into and out of the building at present the doors lay shut. 
These doors are simple in construction but sturdily built to prevent forced
entrance into the important Barracks.  Surprisingly the pair of doors stand
unguarded maybe the guards for the doors stand on the other side of the
door.  The doors are well positioned, far enough into the courtyard so that
any threat that enters can be seen and men can be deployed in enough time to
prevent the garrisoned army from being gutted by invaders.

A corner of the inner courtyard~
The wall ends here, leading only back to the west, the courtyard
continues south following along the side of the Barrack's wall.  The end of
the northern wall signals the end of the Bastion of the Light.  The wall was
constructed using well-cut stones and must have been from the looks of it
constructed by artisans well versed in the craft of stone lying.  The
building towers far above, roughly six floors high it must be the tallest
building in the Fortress.  This building is situated in the very northern
half of the Inner courtyard far from the Inner gate and main stables.  To
the west at the end of the wall lies the entrance to the Inner courtyards
gardens, further south of them almost directly beside the Western chord of
the perimeter wall are the Gallows and the gate leading down into the
dungeons that lie beneath.  The main stables of the Inner courtyard are
located in the southwest area of the courtyard cleverly placed right next to
the Inner gate into the courtyard so they can handle the stabling of any
mounts that are brought into the Inner courtyard.  Further east are located
two large and rather tall buildings, the further northern one is the North
barracks, used to station Children of the Light while the other, slightly
taller one must be the guests quarters where all guests, political or other
stay.  The Inner courtyard is structured within the boundaries set by the
perimeter walls which stand tall forming a circle around the courtyard and
its buildings.

Before the towering doors of the Bastion of the Light~
Towering above is the Fortress of the Light's main building, referred to
and called by a large range of names, The Bastion of the Light, The Heart of
the Light and most of the time simply as The Fortress of the Light.  It as a
beautiful and well thought out building, its exterior walls constructed
mainly using stone with little areas of vein less white marble the majority
of which are used beneath the tower's windows.  The doors to the north
stands open giving a clear view into the building, the scene inside is quite
something, runners of silk run along the busy corridors with the odd
tapestry or shield on the wall, as well as these there are many lamps and
lanterns mounted either on the wall or placed in steel stands, their great
number lights up the interior making more of the building visible.  The
majority of people that enter this building are Children of the Light with a
few non-children coming in, the majority of which are the Children's
servants wearing white and gold livery.  The air here is pervaded by the
sweet smell of some short of smelling herb of some sort which is carried by
the servants through out the Fortress' corridors to make them smell nice. 
The rest of the Inner courtyard lies back to the south all of it visible
from here, all the buildings can be seen, the Guest Quarters to the east,
the North barracks also to the east just further north than the Guest
quarters, on the other side of the courtyard, the west side, are the gardens
and the Gallows, and a little to the south is the main stable of the Inner
courtyard.

Leading into the gardens of the Inner courtyard~
This is the southern boundary of the Fortress' gardens, they stretch to
the north and are sparsely vegetated, with only one real clump of flora,
that being a dense copse in the far northern part of the Garden.  There are
quite a few special sights in the Gardens, some rare and magnificent trees
and plants, such as the Great Oak that resides in the western half of the
garden, it towers high with its gnarled branches providing shade for those
beneath it.  As well as the oak, there is a Redwood, another rare type of
tree, this one is not nearly as big as the Great Oak but what the Redwood
lacks in size, it makes up for in looks, its bark is extremely smooth and is
a beautiful shade of light brown mixed with red, its branches are just as
pretty, with pine like leaves that jut off every single branch.  There is a
more or less defined pathway that leads into and through the gardens to the
north, it breaks of into other paths and various points traversing the
entire garden.  The rest of the courtyard continues its busy life to the
south and east.  From here most of the Inner courtyard is visible, the
Gallows, The Gate of Bereavement, the main stable all to the south, far to
the east, the North barracks, the guest quarters and the main gate into the
Inner courtyard.  Heading north follows along beside the western wall of the
Fortress' main building, towering high overhead.

Before one of the Inner courtyard's gatehouses~
Just to the south from here is one of the Inner Gate's guardhouses.  It
is well maintained by the Children that are assigned to it, always being
kept neat and tidy, weapons on the racks, heavy chairs round the table in
the center.  It projects the perfect image of the Children of the Light,
neat and aware of their surroundings.  However, this is but one mere face of
the many that the Children portray.  The gatehouse is a tall building,
stretching up to the upper part of the gate where in the portcullis resides.
Within the gatehouse there is a wide ladder, made from wood, which leads
upwards through a trapdoor, the ladder leads into the upper floor of the
gatehouse, where another group of guards stand watch, maybe even some
archers.  In the Fortress of the Light there are two main courtyards, the
first is the Outer courtyard, the area at the entrance of the Fortress, the
second is this area, the area beyond the Inner gate.  Both courtyards are
surrounded by perimeter walls, walls, which form a circular pattern within
which the courtyards are laid out.  Traffic in this courtyard is light, few
people flo through the Inner gate located to the southwest.  It is light
compared to that that traverses the other courtyard, the traffic here is
purely people, no wagons or carts just people.  Further north beyond the
Guests Quarters entrance is the North barracks and its entrance.  To the
west beyond the stable are the notorious Gallows and the equally famed Gate
of Bereavement from which sentenced Followers of the Dark are brought out to
meet the creator.  The pinnacle of the Inner courtyard is the building that
resides to the east of the Gardens on the north side of the courtyard.  The
Fortress of the Light, the Bastion of the Light the name matters not but its
great ambience does, its perfectly smooth stone walls with specs of marble
laced intermittently through out are stunning, it is quite a work off art. 
Even more astounding than the main building is what lies on top of it, the
Famed Dome of Truth, heart of the Children of the Light, center of its power
and justice, its gold leaf exterior just visible from here in the Inner
courtyard.

Along the side of the stable's wall~
To the west, here resides the Inner courtyard's stable wall.  The wall
is made from soft stone carefully cut and placed to construct a rather tall
building.  The wall still looks new, with only a little bit of erosion
visible around the edges of the stones.  The entrance to the stable is a
break in the wall to the north, a pair of wide doors lie open at the
entrance allowing free flow of people both into and out of the Stable.  The
notorious stenches associated with stables pervade this room, stale straw
mixed with manure, not a pleasant smell, but a smell that can be easily
ignored by working with animals and being subjected to it.  The rest of the
Inner courtyard continues around this stable building flowing in its many
directions leading to the many buildings that line its borders.  Traffic
flows gently through the Inner courtyard traffic being light only, people
and mounted men no wagons or carts of any sort.  The majority of mounted men
ride over to the stables to stable their mounts while they deal with their
business in the Fortress.

Before an entrance to the main stable of the Inner courtyard~
Here just to the west are a pair of large doors which at current stand
open, they lead from the smell of it into the main stables of the Inner
courtyard, cleverly situated right by the main gate into the Inner
courtyard.  The smell emitted by the stables is a mixture or old hay, animal
excrement and sweat, human by the stink of it, a not so surprising mixture
considering the large number of animals and people that either reside or
work in the tall building.  The stable building is of rather strange
construction, it is tall almost as tall as the Inner perimeter walls yet has
only one floor, why it was built like this is a very good question to ask. 
The eastern side and a little of the northern side of the Inner courtyard
are the only parts visible from this point, as the rest of the courtyard is
blocked from sight by the stable building.  The buildings that can be seen
are from the looks of it, the Guest quarters, which is situated to the east
and a little north, the North Barracks which is just north of the guest
quarters and from the looks of it they are linked together.  The only other
building visible is the Bastion of the Light, its stone and marble mixed
walls shining in the sun light that streaks down into the courtyard. 
Various traffic flows into and out of the main gate, which is to the south
and east, the people coming in are mainly Children with a few exceptions.

Along the stable~
To the west, here resides the Inner courtyard's stable wall.  The wall
is made from soft stone carefully cut and placed to construct a rather tall
building.  The wall still looks new, with only a little bit of erosion
visible around the edges of the stones.  The entrance to the stable is a
break in the wall to the south, a pair of wide doors lie open at the
entrance allowing free flow of people both into and out of the Stable.  The
notorious stenches associated with stables pervade this room, stale straw
mixed with manure, not a pleasant smell, but a smell that can be easily
ignored by working with animals and being subjected to it.  The rest of the
Inner courtyard continues around this stable building flowing in its many
directions leading to the many buildings that line its borders.  Traffic
flows gently through the Inner courtyard traffic being light only, people
and mounted men no wagons or carts of any sort.  The majority of mounted men
ride over to the stables to stable their mounts while they deal with their
business in the Fortress.

The courtyard passes the main stables~
This vast area of land which is bordered by various buildings and at
some points stone circular walls is know through out the Fortress of the
Light as the Inner courtyard.  In the Fortress of the Light there are two
main courtyards, the first is the Outer courtyard, the area at the entrance
of the Fortress, the second is this area, the area beyond the Inner gate. 
Both courtyards are surrounded by perimeter walls, walls, which form a
circular pattern within which the courtyards are laid out.  Traffic in this
courtyard is light, light compared to that that traverses the other
courtyard, the traffic here is purely people, no wagons or carts just
people.  Many of the people of members of the Children of the Light but an
equal number are not, these other people come from a wide range of people,
those looking to join the Children, Nobles requesting audiences with the
Council of Anointed or even some times the Children's servants wearing white
and gold livery.  These people move through the Inner courtyard, heading
towards many of the buildings located here.  On the eastern side of the
courtyard rests the North Barracks and just to the south of that the Guests
Quarters, the main stable of this courtyard is strategically placed next to
the Inner gate on the southern side.  To the west beyond the stable are the
notorious Gallows and the equally famed Gate of Bereavement from which
sentenced Followers of the Dark are brought out to meet the creator.  The
pinnacle of the Inner courtyard is the building that resides to the east of
the Gardens on the north side of the courtyard.  The Fortress of the Light,
the Bastion of the Light the name matters not but its great ambience does,
its perfectly smooth stone walls with specs of marble laced intermittently
through out are stunning, it is quite a work off art.  Even more astounding
than the main building is what lies on top of it, the Famed Dome of Truth,
heart of the Children of the Light, center of its power and justice, its
gold leaf exterior just visible from here in the Inner courtyard.

The Inner courtyard along the stable wall~
This area of the Inner courtyard is bordered by a stonewall that blocks
the south.  The wall stretches west and east leading through the courtyard,
the wall belongs to the Inner courtyard's main stables.  The stable is a
large building both tall and wide, and sturdily constructed a necessity for
a building that is frequented by those owning mounts in the Fortress.  A
familiar smell pervades the air here, emitted from the occupants of the
stable, the smell is a mix of stale hay and straw mixed in with horse
manure, it is not a pleasant smell.  The Inner courtyard continues to the
north of this face of the stable, it flows through the empty space between
the various and plentiful buildings that border the tall Inner perimeter
walls.  The dreaded gallows can be seen from here to the north west and
slightly hidden behind the gallows is the notorious Gate of Bereavement. 
Standing out like an Aielman in the Wetlands is the Gold-leafed Dome of
Truth, some believe it to be the Heart of the Children of the Light, others
to be the creators own weapon against the Dark One, it sits on top of the
Fortress' main building gleaming brightly as the light reflects of its
golden exterior.

Before the main stable's other entrance~
This exit from the odorous stables leads into the western side of the
Inner courtyard, where, situated just to the north from here reside the
notorious Gallows of the Inner courtyard.  The Gallows are essentially
hidden from the south eastern side of the Inner courtyard by the main
stables but they still can be located, usually due to the sheer volume of
both people and noise coming from the area as many people enjoy hangings. 
From this entrance to the stables the entire Inner courtyard unfolds, its
many buildings now in plain sight, the largest and most breath taking being
the Bastion of the Light referred to by many names, The Fortress of the
Light by some, The Bastion of Truth by others and even The Heart of the
Light and it is just that, its smooth marble and stone walls are quite a
site, a site that is topped of by the view of the Dome of Truth that resides
on the top of the building..  The foul smell of the stables still hangs in
the air here but it is dissipated slightly by the other various smells
coming from the courtyard, those of sweat, grease and pine, from the gardens
to the north.  Through out the entire Inner courtyard roam many Children of
the Light and members of the Hand as well doing a large variety of tasks,
running errands, checking on men, heading into Amador for a drink and one
its many taverns or heading off to the many Children camps that reside
nearby, within riding distance.

Along the stable's wall in the Inner courtyard~
The tall and menacing gallows are in plain sight from here, rising up
above the Inner courtyard for all to see.  The rest of the Inner courtyard
continues on stretching in all directions leading to the many different
places that are linked by the Inner courtyard.  Along the eastern wall are
two buildings, linked at a point, the buildings must be the Northern
Barracks and the Guest's Quarters.  The northern wall is home to the main
building of the Fortress of the light, the Bastion of the Light, the massive
building rises miles up, above the height of the Inner courtyard walls even,
dwarfing the entire area.  It is about five to six floors upwards with
spiraling towers on top of which pennants are flown, pennants that gently
flap about in the light breeze.  The pennants that fly are of two kinds, one
is the Blazing sunburst of the Children while the other is the blood-red
Shepard's crook of the Hand.  People mill about through out the entire
courtyard, moving to and fro.  The majority of the Inner courtyard's
occupants are members of the Children of the Light with a few non-children
present for various reasons, some to watch the hangings, others looking to
join and even some coming form meetings with the Council of Anointed.  The
courtyard is free of any heavy traffic as wooden carts and wagons are not
allowed into the Inner courtyard, these must be left outside, in the Outer
Courtyard.  Strangely enough, the Inner courtyard has no distinguishing
smell, many aromas float about ranging from visiting Ladies perfume to the
sweat of the Children of the Light but nothing un-usual or out of place. 
Here lining the south and running east is the Inner courtyard's stable wall.

gallows~
These well built and sturdy gallows are the permanent type, not
scaffolding that is hastily constructed but proper, heavy oak gallows, built
high off the ground above the Inner courtyard for all to see.  There are
about fifteen trap doors along the gallows and at each trapdoor, hanging
from the wooden beam above is a length of rope, which is used to hang the
victims.  The only way up to the gallows is a single staircase, cleverly
placed behind the gallows so as to prevent the crowd from storming it, the
staircase is guarded by a number of Children of the Light preventing those
not being hung and not of the Children from ascending the stairs.  On the
platform there is a small walkway behind the trapdoors that runs the entire
length of the gallows, when the time to hang the victims arrives, armed
Children of the Light mount the gallows, and spread themselves out along
this plank standing guard.  A simple lever at the far end of the gallows is
thrown to trigger the trapdoors, sending those Light blinded Darkfriends to
meet the Creator himself.

meet the Creator himself.  Death comes in two forms when hanging from the
gallows, a quick merciful death by the victim's neck breaking from the
forced drop and snagging of the rope or, a slow most painful death by
strangulation as the rope slowly chokes the life from the victim, a death
the Creator himself places upon Darkfriends.  The crowd cheer loudly as the
hear the loud snapping of necks breaking or the quiet choking of those being
hung, each death fuels the crowds as the roar and cheer and praise the
Light.  Many stop to watch those being hanged, guards on the battlements
above lean over, deserting their posts for a minute or so to watch the
hangings.  These hangings are a regular event, taking place almost everyday
and sometimes more than once a day.  From the gallows themselves the entire
Inner courtyard can be viewed, quite a sight to see be it the last the
victim shall see and they shall die seeing it as unlike many other places
where hanging takes place, here the victims are not blindfolded.

The Gate of Bereavement~
In this far corner of the Inner Courtyard lies a large metal gate that
half juts out of the hard dirt surface of the courtyard.  The gate is
infamous, known through out Amador and the Fortress of the Light.  Brought
out from this gate are the Friends of the Dark that admit to their sins,
they are lead out, feet chained together shuffling along past the erected
scaffolding that will provide for them their ultimate demise, moving through
a gap, created in the gathering crowd by armed Children.  As they move
through the crowd, they come under attack from all sides and in all forms,
they are sworn at, being thrown some of the most painful and heart breaking
curses, pelted with rotten vegetables and refuse and many times attacked
physically by the crowd, such attacks are quickly put down by the guards. 
The gate is exquisite, made from soft somber iron.  The Iron forms a row of
equally spaced horizontal bars about fifteen in total, each bars ends are
curled and curved ornately.  Crossing the vertical bars are more such bars,
these ones running west to east, horizontally creating the cage like
appearance for which they are famous.  In the dead center of the gate, more
iron depicts a scene, and a grizzly scene at that, the imprint in the Iron
is that of a face swathe in pain, suffering and anguish screaming for mercy
to those that stand by and watch, slowly counting the number of people that
are brought out from the gate.  Two guards stand watch over the gate, both
guards identically dressed in the regimental dress of the Children of the
Light, complete with spot-less white cloak and blazing sunburst.  Torches
light the passageway behind the gate, one on either side of the passage,
carrying light down the otherwise gloomy stairs.

occupants are members of the Children of the Light with a few non-children
present for various reasons, some to watch the hangings, others looking to
join and even some coming form meetings with the Council of Anointed.  The
courtyard is free of any heavy traffic as wooden carts and wagons are not
allowed into the Inner courtyard, these must be left outside, in the Outer
Courtyard.  Strangely enough, the Inner courtyard has no distinguishing
smell, many aromas float about ranging from visiting Ladies perfume to the
sweat of the Children of the Light but nothing un-usual or out of place.

gallows~
These well built and sturdy gallows are the permanent type, not
scaffolding that is hastily constructed but proper, heavy oak gallows, built
high off the ground above the Inner courtyard for all to see.  There are
about fifteen trap doors along the gallows and at each trapdoor, hanging
from the wooden beam above is a length of rope, which is used to hang the
victims.  The only way up to the gallows is a single staircase, cleverly
placed behind the gallows so as to prevent the crowd from storming it, the
staircase is guarded by a number of Children of the Light preventing those
not being hung and not of the Children from ascending the stairs.  On the
platform there is a small walkway behind the trapdoors that runs the entire
length of the gallows, when the time to hang the victims arrives, armed
Children of the Light mount the gallows, and spread themselves out along
this plank standing guard.  A simple lever at the far end of the gallows is
thrown to trigger the trapdoors, sending those Light blinded Darkfriends to
meet the Creator himself.

A good view of the Gallows from the Inner courtyard~
The tall and menacing gallows are in plain sight from here, rising up
above the Inner courtyard for all to see.  The rest of the Inner courtyard
continues on stretching in all directions leading to the many different
places that are linked by the Inner courtyard.  Along the eastern wall are
two buildings, linked at a point, the buildings must be the Northern
Barracks and the Guest's Quarters.  The northern wall is home to the main
building of the Fortress of the light, the Bastion of the Light, the massive
building rises miles up, above the height of the Inner courtyard walls even,
dwarfing the entire area.  It is about five to six floors upwards with
spiraling towers on top of which pennants are flown, pennants that gently
flap about in the light breeze.  The pennants that fly are of two kinds, one
is the Blazing sunburst of the Children while the other is the blood-red
Shepard's crook of the Hand.  People mill about through out the entire
courtyard, moving to and fro.  The majority of the Inner courtyard's
occupants are members of the Children of the Light with a few non-children

Walking beside the wall of the Fortress~
This wall continues to the west and east and it is the southern wall of
the Bastion of the Light.  The wall was constructed using well-cut stones
and must have been from the looks of it constructed by artisans well versed
in the craft of stone lying.  The building towers far above, roughly six
floors high it must be the tallest building in the Fortress.  This building
is situated in the very northern half of the Inner courtyard far from the
Inner gate and main stables.  To the west at the end of the wall lies the
entrance to the Inner courtyards gardens, further south of them almost
directly beside the Western chord of the perimeter wall are the Gallows and
the gate leading down into the dungeons that lie beneath.  The main stables
of the Inner courtyard are located in the southwest area of the courtyard
cleverly placed right next to the Inner gate into the courtyard so they can
handle the stabling of any mounts that are brought into the Inner courtyard.
Further east are located two large and rather tall buildings, the further
northern one is the North barracks, used to station Children of the Light
while the other, slightly taller one must be the guests quarters where all
guests, political or other stay.  The Inner courtyard is structured within
the boundaries set by the perimeter walls which stand tall forming a circle
around the courtyard and its buildings.

Leading towards the Gardens in the Inner courtard~
This vast area of land which is bordered by various buildings and at
some points stone circular walls is know through out the Fortress of the
Light as the Inner courtyard.  In the Fortress of the Light there are two
main courtyards, the first is the Outer courtyard, the area at the entrance
of the Fortress, the second is this area, the area beyond the Inner gate. 
Both courtyards are surrounded by perimeter walls, walls, which form a
circular pattern within which the courtyards are laid out.  Traffic in this
courtyard is light, light compared to that that traverses the other
courtyard, the traffic here is purely people, no wagons or carts just
people.  Many of the people of members of the Children of the Light but an
equal number are not, these other people come from a wide range of people,
those looking to join the Children, Nobles requesting audiences with the
Council of Anointed or even some times the Children's servants wearing white
and gold livery.  These people move through the Inner courtyard, heading
towards many of the buildings located here.  On the eastern side of the
courtyard rests the North Barracks and just to the south of that the Guests
Quarters, the main stable of this courtyard is strategically placed next to
the Inner gate on the southern side.  To the west beyond the stable are the
notorious Gallows and the equally famed Gate of Bereavement from which
sentenced Followers of the Dark are brought out to meet the creator.  The
pinnacle of the Inner courtyard is the building that resides to the east of
the Gardens on the north side of the courtyard.  The Fortress of the Light,
the Bastion of the Light the name matters not but its great ambience does,
its perfectly smooth stone walls with specs of marble laced intermittently
through out are stunning, it is quite a work off art.  Even more astounding
than the main building is what lies on top of it, the Famed Dome of Truth,
heart of the Children of the Light, center of its power and justice, its
gold leaf exterior just visible from here in the Inner courtyard.  The
Gardens are to the north, the Great Oak in it standing clearly visible from
here.

the Bastion of the Light the name matters not but its great ambience does,
its perfectly smooth stone walls with specs of marble laced intermittently

Heading away from the Inner courtyard's stables~
This vast area of land which is bordered by various buildings and at
some points stone circular walls is know through out the Fortress of the
Light as the Inner courtyard.  In the Fortress of the Light there are two
main courtyards, the first is the Outer courtyard, the area at the entrance
of the Fortress, the second is this area, the area beyond the Inner gate. 
Both courtyards are surrounded by perimeter walls, walls, which form a
circular pattern within which the courtyards are laid out.  Traffic in this
courtyard is light, light compared to that that traverses the other
courtyard, the traffic here is purely people, no wagons or carts just
people.  Many of the people of members of the Children of the Light but an
equal number are not, these other people come from a wide range of people,
those looking to join the Children, Nobles requesting audiences with the
Council of Anointed or even some times the Children's servants wearing white
and gold livery.  These people move through the Inner courtyard, heading
towards many of the buildings located here.  On the eastern side of the
courtyard rests the North Barracks and just to the south of that the Guests
Quarters, the main stable of this courtyard is strategically placed next to
the Inner gate on the southern side.  To the west beyond the stable are the

of the Fortress, the second is this area, the area beyond the Inner gate. 
Both courtyards are surrounded by perimeter walls, walls, which form a
circular pattern within which the courtyards are laid out.  Traffic in this
courtyard is light, light compared to that that traverses the other
courtyard, the traffic here is purely people, no wagons or carts just
people.  Many of the people of members of the Children of the Light but an
equal number are not, these other people come from a wide range of people,
those looking to join the Children, Nobles requesting audiences with the
Council of Anointed or even some times the Children's servants wearing white
and gold livery.  These people move through the Inner courtyard, heading
towards many of the buildings located here.  On the eastern side of the
courtyard rests the North Barracks and just to the south of that the Guests
Quarters, the main stable of this courtyard is strategically placed next to
the Inner gate on the southern side.  To the west beyond the stable are the
notorious Gallows and the equally famed Gate of Bereavement from which
sentenced Followers of the Dark are brought out to meet the creator.  The
pinnacle of the Inner courtyard is the building that resides to the east of
the Gardens on the north side of the courtyard.  The Fortress of the Light,
the Bastion of the Light the name matters not but its great ambience does,
its perfectly smooth stone walls with specs of marble laced intermittently
through out are stunning, it is quite a work off art.  Even more astounding
than the main building is what lies on top of it, the Famed Dome of Truth,
heart of the Children of the Light, center of its power and justice, its
gold leaf exterior just visible from here in the Inner courtyard.

Into the Inner courtyard's center~
This vast area of land which is bordered by various buildings and at
some points stone circular walls is know through out the Fortress of the
Light as the Inner courtyard.  In the Fortress of the Light there are two
main courtyards, the first is the Outer courtyard, the area at the entrance
of the Fortress, the second is this area, the area beyond the Inner gate. 
Both courtyards are surrounded by perimeter walls, walls, which form a
circular pattern within which the courtyards are laid out.  Traffic in this
courtyard is light, light compared to that that traverses the other
courtyard, the traffic here is purely people, no wagons or carts just
people.  Many of the people of members of the Children of the Light but an
equal number are not, these other people come from a wide range of people,
those looking to join the Children, Nobles requesting audiences with the
Council of Anointed or even some times the Children's servants wearing white
and gold livery.  These people move through the Inner courtyard, heading
towards many of the buildings located here.  On the eastern side of the
courtyard rests the North Barracks and just to the south of that the Guests
Quarters, the main stable of this courtyard is strategically placed next to
the Inner gate on the southern side.  To the west beyond the stable are the
notorious Gallows and the equally famed Gate of Bereavement from which
sentenced Followers of the Dark are brought out to meet the creator.  The
pinnacle of the Inner courtyard is the building that resides to the east of
the Gardens on the north side of the courtyard.  The Fortress of the Light,
the Bastion of the Light the name matters not but its great ambience does,
its perfectly smooth stone walls with specs of marble laced intermittently
through out are stunning, it is quite a work off art.  Even more astounding
than the main building is what lies on top of it, the Famed Dome of Truth,
heart of the Children of the Light, center of its power and justice, its
gold leaf exterior just visible from here in the Inner courtyard.

Into the Inner courtyard~
This vast area of land which is bordered by various buildings and at
some points stone circular walls is know through out the Fortress of the
Light as the Inner courtyard.  In the Fortress of the Light there are two
main courtyards, the first is the Outer courtyard, the area at the entrance
of the Fortress, the second is this area, the area beyond the Inner gate. 
Both courtyards are surrounded by perimeter walls, walls, which form a
circular pattern within which the courtyards are laid out.  Traffic in this
courtyard is light, light compared to that that traverses the other
courtyard, the traffic here is purely people, no wagons or carts just
people.  Many of the people of members of the Children of the Light but an
equal number are not, these other people come from a wide range of people,
those looking to join the Children, Nobles requesting audiences with the
Council of Anointed or even some times the Children's servants wearing white
and gold livery.  These people move through the Inner courtyard, heading
towards many of the buildings located here.  On the eastern side of the
courtyard rests the North Barracks and just to the south of that the Guests
Quarters, the main stable of this courtyard is strategically placed next to
the Inner gate on the southern side.  To the west beyond the stable are the
notorious Gallows and the equally famed Gate of Bereavement from which
sentenced Followers of the Dark are brought out to meet the creator.  The
pinnacle of the Inner courtyard is the building that resides to the east of
the Gardens on the north side of the courtyard.  The Fortress of the Light,
the Bastion of the Light the name matters not but its great ambience does,
its perfectly smooth stone walls with specs of marble laced intermittently
through out are stunning, it is quite a work off art.  Even more astounding
than the main building is what lies on top of it, the Famed Dome of Truth,
heart of the Children of the Light, center of its power and justice, its
gold leaf exterior just visible from here in the Inner courtyard.

Along the Bastion of Light~
This wall continues to the west and east and it is the southern wall of
the Bastion of the Light.  The wall was constructed using well-cut stones
and must have been from the looks of it constructed by artisans well versed
in the craft of stone lying.  The building towers far above, roughly six
floors high it must be the tallest building in the Fortress.  This building
is situated in the very northern half of the Inner courtyard far from the
Inner gate and main stables.  To the west at the end of the wall lies the
entrance to the Inner courtyards gardens, further south of them almost
directly beside the Western chord of the perimeter wall are the Gallows and
the gate leading down into the dungeons that lie beneath.  The main stables
of the Inner courtyard are located in the southwest area of the courtyard
cleverly placed right next to the Inner gate into the courtyard so they can
handle the stabling of any mounts that are brought into the Inner courtyard.
Further east are located two large and rather tall buildings, the further
northern one is the North barracks, used to station Children of the Light
while the other, slightly taller one must be the guests quarters where all
guests, political or other stay.  The Inner courtyard is structured within
the boundaries set by the perimeter walls which stand tall forming a circle
around the courtyard and its buildings.

In the Light of Friends~
In this end of the gardens, two men stand deep in conversation.  It is
painstakingly obvious from the dress of the two men that they are members of
the Hand of the Light, their white tabards with blood red Shepard's crooks
behind a sunburst being the most obvious features of this.  The area the men
stand in is rather strange, this part of the Garden is blocked off from site
from the rest of the Garden's by a well positioned hedge and from the rest
of the Inner courtyard to the south by a small railing only covering half
the width of this area.  Why the two men choose this place to confer is
obvious, it is well known that matters within the Hand are extremely secret,
many that learn of these 'secrets' that should not are silenced brutally. 
But there is something else, some other reason why the two men stand here in
conversation its as if they were hiding something or guarding something at
least though the lack of weapons at their belts leads away from this.  The
bush is well rounded with a few flowering buds scattered around it, its
roots seem to spread more above the soil than below it, perhaps there is a
layer of concrete below that prevents them from digging deep.  The stone
gray wall that runs along here on the western side is covered in layers of
vines and various other creepers, in fact there are so many creepers and
vines that the actually wall is hidden from sight, only recognizable by the
battlements lining its top.

The beginning of the Fortress' gardens~
The Bastion of the Light looms far above, towering over this rather small
garden.  Small only in comparison with the Fortress of the Light, outside of
its massive walls one may consider this garden big and rather significant. 
The garden is dotted with flora ranging from small bushes to the towering
and gnarled Great Oak that stands on the western side of the gardens.  The
Great Oak tree dwarves the gardens but it is still nothing compared to the
Bastion of the Light.  At the northern end of the gardens is a rather low
but dense copse of flowering trees.  There are two paths leading through the
Gardens, one leads north with grass on either side of its stony path and
stops before the copse in front of a side entrance into the main Fortress
Building, commonly called the actually Fortress of the Light or even
sometimes the Bastion of the Light.  The second path breaks of the main one
heading west towards the base of the Great Oak where by it breaks north
ending in a vine covered wall, a wall belonging to the perimeter walls that
surround the Inner courtyard.  Through out the gardens are various children,
some wandering through the tranquil gardens, others coming here to practice
there sword as the Lord Captain beneath the Great Oak does, or some even
come here to hold discussions Strangely there are more members of the Hand
of the Light here than there are in any other parts of the Fortress, that
fact alone is rather unique, there must be something special about the
garden.

A side entrance into the Fortress~
Here there is a rather large door built into the side of the Fortress, it
obviously leads into the interior of the building.  The door serves two
purposes, letting officers into the Fortress from the Gardens through this
door without notice and it allows people to slip from the Fortress without
notice.  The door is ornately carved with various carvings and inscriptions
obviously carved by an artisan well versed in woodcarving and such similar
trades.  The door has also been well placed, almost hidden from view from
the Inner courtyard, masked by the rare Redwood tree that is located on the
eastern side of the garden.  The rest of the garden helps to camouflage the
door, surrounding it on all sides.  Towering above it the Fortress with its
smooth stonewalls with odd patches of marble spotting the wall at various
places.  The garden is dotted with flora ranging from small bushes to the
towering and gnarled Great Oak that stands on the western side of the
gardens.  The Great Oak tree dwarves the gardens but it is still nothing
compared to the Bastion of the Light.  Various members of the Children of
the Light move through out the Gardens, some use it as a way out of the
Fortress, avoiding the main entrance others use the Gardens as a place to
put there mind at rest, and some even come here to train in its peace.

Entering a small copse of trees~
This dense clump of trees is dark, the sheer number of trees forming a
thick canopy overhead which blocks most of the light out, but not all of it.
Through various gaps in the leaves sun light does manage to break in, adding
a little bit of luminance to the copse.  There is no real path through the
small copse but the foliage does allow passage in some directions, to the
west the gathered trees leave enough space to move freely in that direction.
The thick gathering of trees to the east mask the stone walls of the
Fortress not allowing passage in that direction, returning back to the south
could be quite a challenge as the trees that bar that way look extremely
bushy and hard to break through.  The dirt ground here is dry not surprising
considering the amount of interception the thick canopy performs, trapping
and stopping the rain from saturating the ground.

A dark area of thick trees~
The light does not manage to penetrate this area of trees, being blocked
by the thick canopy of trees that swarm the area.  The trees are all
extremely bushy making movement through the area both painful and difficult.
The rest of the copse can just be seen in the dim light to the south and
tiny specs of light penetrate the copse there.  There is the distinct
feeling that there is someone else in this room hiding away in the trees, 
watching silently, a strange feeling, a very strange feeling.  The air here
is suprisingly light, and fresh being replaced by currents that manage to
break through the thick layer of trees, but a smell of fresh wet grass also
pervades this area.  The smell is out of place as even with the heaviest
rain the trees intercept it and most of the time prevent it from reaching
the ground.  Maybe there is a source of water or something running through
the copse nearby.

A small copse of trees~
A few threads of light that manage to penetrate the thick foliage that
surrounds the area breach the darkness here.  The dark, gloomy trees
surround here, preventing movement in any direction except for south where
the trees are less spaced together and where the light source is coming in. 
Back to the east the trees may just be wide enough spaced to move in that
direction, but the lack of light makes it hard to determine.  The ground
here is dry and hard due to the lack of rain.

The Fortress' gardens, nearing a dark copse of trees~
The Bastion of the Light looms far above, towering over this rather
small garden.  Small only in comparison with the Fortress of the Light,
outside of its massive walls one may consider this garden big and rather
significant.  The garden is dotted with flora ranging from small bushes to
the towering and gnarled Great Oak that stands on the western side of the
gardens.  The Great Oak tree dwarves the gardens but it is still nothing
compared to the Bastion of the Light.  At the northern end of the gardens is
a rather low but dense copse of flowering trees.  There are two paths
leading through the Gardens, one leads north with grass on either side of
its stony path and stops before the copse in front of a side entrance into
the main Fortress Building, commonly called the actually Fortress of the
Light or even sometimes the Bastion of the Light.  The second path breaks of
the main one heading west towards the base of the Great Oak where by it
breaks north ending in a vine covered wall, a wall belonging to the
perimeter walls that surround the Inner courtyard.  Through out the gardens
are various children, some wandering through the tranquil gardens, others
coming here to practice there sword as the Lord Captain beneath the Great
Oak does, or some even come here to hold discussions Strangely there are
more members of the Hand of the Light here than there are in any other parts
of the Fortress, that fact alone is rather unique, there must be something
special about the garden.  To the north lies the dense copse of trees.

In the shade of a rare red-wood tree~
Towering overhead is rare and beautiful redwood tree.  Its bark is soft
very soft and shaded a light reddish brown, the structure of its leaves and
their texture tell that the tree is coniferous, or evergreen as it is
sometimes called.  With pine like green leaves that stretch outward reaching
quite far, the main reason why, there under this tree is a great place to
avoid the sun.  There is a man dressed in the garments of an Officer in the
Children here, meditating under the tree, his breathing is slow and rhythmic
and his hands rest limply on his thighs.  Strangely his sword and scabbard
is nowhere in site, most Children of the Light would rather cut their own
hand off before removing their sword blade except when entering the Dome of
Truth.  The rest of the garden continues, surrounding this Tree and its
shaded ground beneath, the path continues heading towards the small yet
dense copse of trees to the north and it returns to the south heading out of
the gardens and passing the second path.  The second path breaks off the
main one heading towards a vine-covered wall where two Inquisitors stand
deep in conversation.  A Great Oak tree is visible to the west, its massive
branches dwarfing the Redwood's but standing still taller than the Oak is
the Fortress of the Light, it towers overhead, dwarfing the entire area.

In the glory of a Great Oak~
The gray stonewalls of the Fortress of the Light are hidden overhead by
the towering Great Oak and its gnarled branches.  Beneath the Great Oak it
is perfectly calm, the shadow cast down by its branches adding an eerie
sensation to the small area basking in the Oak's glory.  The surreal silence
is broken only by the heavy breathing and soft stepping of the man who
prances about beneath the Great Oak.  Wielding cold steel, the man moves
backwards, forwards leaning in all directions, he crouches, ducks, rolls,
jumps, he does every sort of movement possible and while doing it, he is one
with his blade, lashing out with it, stabbing, slashing, blocking and even
sheathing it.  Undoubtedly this man is a Blademaster, the way he flows in
his movement and the total concentration he holds on his blade and his
imaginary target is great, he channels all emotions out through the void,
concentrating solely on the blade and his target.  It is quite spectacular
to watch even though the slight musky smell of sweat lingers in the air. 
The whole scene is quite symbolic, A man one with his blade practicing
beneath the towering Great Oak, ignoring everything, even the few people
also in the gardens watching him work the forms, ignoring his tiredness and
his now watery muscles, letting sweat drip from every pore.  A slight breeze
rustles the Great Oak its branches swaying slightly as if they were cheering
on the Blademaster beneath them, showering down their praises, quite surreal
indeed.

In a tangle of vines~
Vines and creepers block the the sunlight from view casting this area
into totally darkess, a tiny strand of light manages to penetrate through
the thick bushy layers of vines.  Perhaps that is the way out of this tangle
A heavy musky smell seems to hang in the air and the rythmical sound of
dripping water can be heard its source unknown due to the darkness.  These
vines were not hiding the Fortress' walls as it seemed obviously they were
cunningly placed to obscure this little area but for what purpose.  Strange,
very strange.

The corridor bends north and east~
This dull and dimly lit corridor leads through this damp underground
area.  Its rough stonewalls hold various hanging torches or lanterns which
give of a dim light.  There are few doors along this corridor, but behind
the doors are a variety of different rooms, there is the High Inquisitor's
chambers, the two torture chambers, the supply room, numerous officers and
the only way out, the grating at the entrance on the western edge.  There is
a slight stench of moss and sweat present in the area and the constant
dripping of water can also be heard coming from further along the corridor. 
A dark and heavy set door lies to the west, a door that leads into one of
the Torture chambers of the area.  The corridor continues east as it bends
while it returns to the north.

A sinister torture chamber~
This chamber is rather large, stretching to the west and south leading
into the corners of the room.  The closed door to the east is the only way
into and out of this torture chamber and the door is watched over by an
armed Inquisitor, making sure none of the prisoners attempt to escape.  Each
corner of the room is home to a different set of devices of torture, from
here the wall mounted torches depict a group of hanging Gibbets to the west
under the close guard of another member of the Hand, a blazing forge and an
operating table are situated to the south watching over these two are an
Inquisitor and a Forge-master.  To the south-west a wicked looking Iron
Maiden is resting against the wall and next to it sits an evil looking
wooden rack and as all the other machines here, a member of the Hand watches
over them.  The room seems to glow red, an effect caused by the reflecting
of the wall mounted torches off the blood red colored walls.  As well as the
dark color, a sinister sense seems to envelope the room, emanating from the
evil torture machines and their righteous guards.  Two smells invade this
room, one is a heavy, musky smell, that of stale sweat, the other is darker,
more sinister, that of rotting flesh and decaying bodies.

An area of hanging gibbets~
This room is used mainly for the holding of tortured prisoners, they are
held in gibbets which hang over head, held up by strong chains attached to
winches on the near wall.  Each gibbet hangs individually but all of them
are near enough to each other so that those prisoners who are able to talk
can do so.  The gibbet is of a rather simple design, all ar identical,
consisting of a dome-topped cage that is rather short, in fact they are so
short that the prisoners in them can not stand, they have to crouch of stoop
and those that are lucky enough and small enough can dangle their legs
through the flat bars of the cage.  There are roughly ten gibbets hanging in
the room, not a great number but more than is necessary.  Standing below the
gibbets, keeping watch over their occupants is an alert Inquisitor nothing
seems to avoid his eye.  He is also standing near enough to the winches that
he can alter them as the need may be raising the height of some or lowering
that of others, the Inquisitor is rather well built, he has to be to be able
to move the gibbets about as, each gibbet is made from heavy iron and the
person occupying the gibbet's weight adds to the weight of the iron, the
winches provide little aid in the moving of the gibbets.  The room is lit by
two wall torches, both are mounted into the stone red walls and both give
off a strange red glow resonating from the color of the walls.

An operating area~
This corner of the dim torture chamber is home to a large operating table
and sitting next to the operating table is a trolley made from steel on
which the Inquisitor's evil tools are kept ready to be used to extract the
truth from any individual that is hiding something.  An Inquisitor stands
watch over the Operating table, securing patients and if the need may be
carrying out a torture session.  The operating table is well constructed, it
is slightly tilted backwards raising the patient's legs slightly above there
head so that any cuts will produce more pain, less blood and also so that
all the blood flows backwards on the table being drained from the table by a
small hole at the head of the operating table which carries the copper
tasting liquid away.  There is also, here a small forge used for
super-heating tools to produce even more pain, next to the forge stands a
tall man, also an inquisitor.  The air here is musky and carries a heavy
smell of rotting flesh.

The torture machines~
This room is taken over by two large machines of pain and suffering. 
Leaning heavily against the far wall is one of them, an Iron Maiden, a
coffin like machine made entirely from metal, the inside of this coffin
though is not filled with flowers or satin cushions but with short yet sharp
steel spikes.  It has a hinged door that is extremely heavy and cannot be
opened from the inside as it also is lined with spikes, the exterior of the
Iron Maiden displays a metal figure with a face expressing a look of sheer
anguish.  The other machine in the room is a wooden rack, a device using a
combination of pulleys and rollers used to stretch and pull the victim in
two directions breaking and damaging joints.  There is a large wooden staff
placed in the top pulley forming a crank, when the crank is turned, the
pulleys pull apart exerting great pressure on the victim's joints.  Standing
guard over the two machines is yet another Inquisitor with a cruel smile on
his face, he seems to enjoy seeing people being put through the machines and
loves the look of pain and anger that distorts their faces.  The room is
rather well lit, lit by two lanterns on the two walls, which throw down
enough light to see the two evil machines glinting slightly as the light
runs over them.  There is a slight musky smell, similar to that of stale
sweat, not surprising considering what this large room is used for.

A well lit torture chamber~
This torture chamber is rather vast, and forms a large square.  The
stonewalls of the chamber are a dark color, the exact color is not
determinable due to the low level of light but it resembles a dark blue or
red even.  There are a variety of evil looking machines in this room, the
simplest of them all consists only of two iron rings on a wall, used to
secure prisoners front first so their back is presented to the Inquisitor
standing nearby who is bending a steel-tipped cat-of-nine tails.  As well as
the whipping rings there is a strange contraption consisting of a sharp,
steel tipped pyramid built into the ground, above the pyramid is an equally
strange contraption that is used to raise and lower prisoners using a winch
lashed to the wall.  Obviously the prisoner is attached to the winch and
lowered painstakingly slowly onto the steel tip of the pyramid, to add to
the pain and damage dealt out by the pyramid, weights are attached to the
prisoner's legs.  The last machine is used for many things, it is a wooden
table with a large and sturdy wooden chair sitting next to it.  On the table
are a variety of tools, a Thumbscrew, Neck tong, Head crusher, Pear,
Amadacian Boot and what looks to be a Cat's Paw.  All of them are nasty
instruments used to inflict the maximum amount of pain on a victim.  The
chair has leather restraints built into it to prevent the victim from
escaping while he is tortured.  Through out the chamber various Inquisitors
stand watch over the machines or over the chamber itself.

A well lit corner of the Torture chamber~
Here, the only evidence of any sort of torture or restraint are two large
iron rings that are built into the stone wall.  Both rings are evenly spaced
out, about a pace apart and they are about two above the stone, cold floor. 
The rings must be used to restrain prisoners while they are whipped, a
simple chain being used to attach the prisoner to the rings, once attached
with their back facing the Inquisitor holding the whip the whipping can
begin.  A small iron grate is built into the floor at the bottom of the
dipped floor, built so all blood from victims flows towards the center of
the dip, in this case it is a grate that obviously drains away the blood. 
The rest of the chamber continues to the east and south each with their own
machines of pain and suffering.  All the machines have but one purpose, the
extraction of the Truth through any means necessary, the Inquisitors
overseeing the various machines are also themselves machines, tools used to
extract the truth.  The room reeks of rotting and decayed flesh, made even
worse by the presence of another foul smell, that of stale sweat, how the
Inquisitors put up with must be the work of the creator.

The Interrogation Chamber~
This room is simple, consisting only of a large wooden table and a wooden
chair fitted with straps to restrain victims.  On the table there are many
items most of them made from steel or iron and all of them look extremely
painful.  There is, a Pear, a device used to expand the mouth causing
extreme pain, A thumbscrew for crushing fingers and toes, A Cat's Paw a
wicked looking pitch work used to scrape and pull away flesh, A Head crusher
for inflicting extreme pressure on a victim's head and an Amadacian boot, a
device with gaps in it into which sharp wedges are driven with a hammer. 
All these tools can inflict great pain and suffering on the poor victim of
their use.  The Inquisitor standing by the table smiles evilly as he softly
and gently runs his hands over the tools occupying the table.  This room is
extremely well lit and as well as the tools, there is a lit lantern on the
table, which added to the light given off by the wall torches brightens the
room greatly.  The chamber continues to the west and north leading back to
the entrance of the chamber and also to the Juda's Cradle, situated to the
north.

Torture! Pain! Truth!~
This room contains an extremely simple and equally painful torture
device, Juda's Cradle it is called, named after its creator, Eurias Juda, a
Lord Inquisitor of the Hand who derived this evil device around 545 NE.  The
Inquisitor now dead, was well known and infamous among Darkfriends and many
other people put to the question, he was mainly known for his extreme
tortures and his success with them.  The device is simple I design,
consisting of a large pointed topped cone or pyramid, pyramid in this case,
mounted on a wooden tripod and set into the ground.  Above the pyramid was
an intricate set up of ropes used as a winch and harness, the victim was
attached to the harness by the Inquisitor over seeing the machine after
being secured to the machine, the victim was winched high above the pyramid
and then was lowered sometimes slowly, sometimes quickly onto the sharp tip
of the pyramid, the result was usually the wrecking of the area between the
legs or extreme pain to the same region.  There have been reports of this
device being used with weights also attached to the victim's legs to
increase the damage inflicted.  This area of the torture chamber unlike the
other areas is a little darker, lit only by one wall mounted torch, as
before the air reeks with stale sweat and rotting flesh and extremely
unpleasant smell.  The chamber continues to the west and to the south.

Pain! Torture! in the Iron Maiden~
Its is pitch black inside this Iron Maiden, nothing is visible but
everything can be felt!  Millions of small yet sharp steel spikes attack
from all sides making it impossible to fidget or move about, standing
absoluetly straight and still is the only way to lessen the pain they emit. 
All the sounds made inside the Iron Maiden echo greatly, screams can deafen
and drive its occupants to the brink of insanity as they repeat over and
over again and the sound of laughter and talking its source, outside of the
Iron Maiden can be even more painfull than the blasted spikes!  The only way
out of this Light Blinded device is the way in, but from the inside the door
is far to heavy to open, making any attempt to open the door both hopeless
and painfull as the door is also lined with spikes.

Inside a hanging gibbet~
Light seeps in through the flat bars of this gibbet, from this height
above the ground, the entire torture chamber can be seen.  It is a gruesome
site, not for the faint hearted, as watching people burned by red-hot tools
or stretched until their joints snap is not a pleasant or pretty site. 
There is a slight breeze up here, but even though it provides a little cool
breeze it carries with it an awful stink, that of rotted and decayed corpses
and stale sweat, the smell is over-whelming enough to make one vomit.  From
this gibbet there is no escape, the cage door is securely locked and the
cage is under the watchfull eye of the Inquisitor beneath making sure
prisoners do not attempt to break free.

This stone corridor runs the length of the Northern Barracks, along its
length various doors and other corridors either intersect it or break off
from it.  The majority of these doors lead into the vast resting area for
the troops stationed within the Northern Barracks but there are other areas
accessible by this corridor.  The stone walls of the corridor are plain,
with only a few decorations dotted along it, the majority of which are
either tapestries or shields, bearing emblems mounted on the walls.  The
motley gray color of the wall is rather dull and the wall-mounted torches
that illuminate the corridor do little to enhance this dull appearance.  The
Guest Quarters to the south are left behind totally as the corridor enters

motley gray color of the wall is rather dull and the wall-mounted torches
that illuminate the corridor do little to enhance this dull appearance.  Two
rooms adjoin this part of the corridor, the one to the west acts as a
barracks area for the Children garrisoned in this Barracks, as does the room
to the east.  Both rooms are strangely similar, with like layout, contents
and structure, the only difference is slight and that is the decorations on
the stone walls of the room to the east.

Continuing along the stone corridor~
This stone corridor runs the length of the Northern Barracks, along its
length various doors and other corridors either intersect it or break off
from it.  The majority of these doors lead into the vast resting area for
the troops stationed within the Northern Barracks but there are other areas
accessible by this corridor.  The stone walls of the corridor are plain,
with only a few decorations dotted along it, the majority of which are
either tapestries or shields, bearing emblems mounted on the walls.  The
motley gray color of the wall is rather dull and the wall-mounted torches
that illuminate the corridor do little to enhance this dull appearance.  The
two rooms to the west and east are almost identical and from the looks of it
they both serve as sleeping areas for garrisoned Children in the Fortress of
the Light.  Like the corridor, both rooms were built using similar stones,
stones a strange shade of gray.  The corridor continues, past the doors,
leading both to the north and south.

as to fit as many Children in as possible.

courtyard is used for many purposes one of which is made obvious by the
gallows constructed in its north half.  As well as hanging, Children
practice through out the courtyard sparing with each other or taking combat
lessons.

The beginning of a small courtyard~
This small dusty courtyard serves a variety of purposes, it is used as a
drilling ground for sparring children, a secondary gallows for hanging
Darkfriends and a place to relax in relative comfort, in the shade.  The
main use of this Courtyard seems to be the execution of Darkfriends by
hanging on the gallows built in the northeastern corner of the courtyard. 
Numerous groups of shackled prisoners are escorted here, through the
barracks, past the rows of rooms in which the Soldiers stay and down, here
towards their ultimate end on the hangman's noose.  The sheltered courtyard
is lacking in foliage, mainly due to the fact that the hard and tightly
packed dirt cannot support plant life due to the lack of moisture.  Although
there is no foliage, there is a good deal of shade in the southeastern
corner, mainly from the towering buildings of the fortress.

route through the Barracks.  Three doors border its eastern, northern and
southern ends leading into various different rooms.  From the sign outside
the room to the east, and the three crossed swords on its door, the
Weaponsmith's residents is made rather obvious.  The door to the south,
marked by a white silk cloth that hangs above the door for decoration, leads
into the Infirmary, the place of rest for wounded Soldiers.  While the door
to north must lead into the Armoury for the Northern Barracks, a place where
one man toils over a blazing hot forge and bangs out various armour parts
for the Children of the light.  The main corridor lies to the west.

This room has but one main function, the Treating of the wounded that
fall in battle or are injured in training.  The room is maintained by about
three nurses who bustle from bed to bed tending to those in need.  The room
has a bright ambience to it even though it is lit only by two wall-lanterns,
several decorations spot the room.  Light, white curtains are fitted next to
the beds, curtains that can be pulled around to shield the bed's occupants
from the rest of the infirmary.  As with most infirmaries there is a faint
smell of bandages and herbs used to cure ailments.

reinforcing it with wood.  The stone room is circular in design and light
glints of the various weapons and armor in here as light is thrown down from
the many wall-mounted torches.  The room is used solely to store weapons and
armor for the legionnaires stationed in the Northern Barracks.  Wooden
barrels surround the edge of the room filled with swords, pikes, halberds,
axes and even pilums.  As well as barrels filled will combat weapons, some
others are filled to overflowing with goose-feathered arrows and bows for
the use of the defending archers employed in the Fortress.  As well as the
various weapons filling the room, racks of pristine condition armor sit
around the room, armor such as breast plates, chainmail tunics, plate-mail
bracers, conical helmets, various leggings both plate and chainmail and
boots of many kinds.  Soldiers that have to go on duty pass by here usually
to collect standard issue equipment, equipment, which they have no need to
either by themselves or lack to gold to do so.  The exit is a clear path

Before a pair of great doors~
Two great wooded doors bar the exit to the west.  A large slab of wood is
used to secure the doors, hinged at one end so it can be raised to allow the
doors to be opened.  Reinforcing the simple plank are two burly guards, both
wear the uniform of the Children of the Light and not surprisingly, both are
armed and armored.  This area is remarkable large, large enough to assemble
patrols and send them out in an orderly fashion through to the Inner
courtyard which obviously lies through the doors to the west.  This area of
the Northern Barracks seems to be frequented by those assigned to the
barracks here, as many Children march through passing either to the stables
or through the doors to the Inner courtyard where many guard and patrol
tasks need to be fulfilled.  The Northern barracks' stable lies to the south
while the barracks continues, returning to the east.

opposite in fact, they are carved with intricate designs and patterns which
must have been done by a talented craftsman.  Two large iron rings sit in
the middle of the door used for opening it with ease or closing it for that
matter.

sell a great range of goods, from cloths to clean weapons to food and drink.
One of the shelves on the western side of the shop holds parchments and
various writing utilities, provided so that Children can keep their families
informed as to what they are up to.  The door to the west leads back onto

Guards stationed in the Northern Barracks frequent this stable, using it
to acquire proper mounts for their patrols or guard runs.  Those requiring
military trained mounts can either take one of the many from here or walk
the small distance to the larger stables in the Outer Courtyard.  The stable
is not very large, and this area is the entrance to it, it seems that the
Stable master standing here is the only person that enters into the stalls
at the back of the stable to fetch or return mounts.  The stalls line the
small pathway to the south and from the stalls comes the smell associated
with them, hay and horse manure.  To the north lies the exit from the
Northern Barracks located next to the stables to allow those requiring
mounts a quick and easy exit from the building.

decorations lead in most directions passing the closed doors of offices and
waiting rooms that are situated on this floor.  Further to the north a
staircase can just be seen, an elaborate one, which leads upwards to the
other floors in the Fortress.  Two other similar corridors break leading
west and east from a crossroad further into the floor, to the north.  Guards
stand by these doors dressed in the uniform of the Children of the Light,
they stand alert and ready to repel any attackers and to close and secure
the large doors in the case of an alarm.  The Inner courtyard lies back to
the south, leading out into the open air.  A pair of heavy set doors to the
west and east mark the entrance to the Guard posts for this door, where the
guards on duty work and rest in.

The guard post here is heavily manned with its Guard's on constant
watch.  They do their best to make their presence unknown closed here within
this large office and barracks just of the entrance.  Should the alarm be
raised these well trained guards will not hesitate to secure the Fortress
preventing anyone but children of the light from entering or exiting.  The
guards are also well trained in combat, they all wear swords at their belts
within easy reach should something go wrong.  They maintain a low profile in
the corridors of the main Fortress, liking to catch intruders off guard by
moving quickly and carefully to where the source of an alarm is reported. 
The room consists of a weapons room and barracks area; the weapons room is
rather impressive and consists of a large number of different and nasty
traps as well as pikes, lances and extremely heavily polished metal shields.
The barracks area is used during night duty, whereby the guards work in
shifts.  The door to the east is extremely heavily re-inforced and leads out
of this guard post back into the first floor of the Fortress.

beneath the layer of white is the smooth, cool to the touch, stone that the
walls are made from.  The drab corridors with their plain white walls are
brightened up through the use of tapestries, shields and runners of silk
placed at different intervals through out the floor.  The hallway is rather
empty, it seems that few children loiter on this level, as there are only a
few offices here, the more important areas are situated on the higher
floors.  At either the end of the western and eastern hallway the corridor
bends moving north towards one of the two side entrances to this floor and
the offices located in that vicinity.  The main entrance lies back along the
hallway.  The corridor breaks here into a crossroad and continues in all
cardinal directions.

leading up for this floor, also just to the north, before the magnificent
staircase is a small waiting room for guests.

A busy waiting hall~
The waiting hall here comprises of two main areas, these are the standing
area allocated both here and to the north and the seating to the west and
North West.  The uses of these areas are obvious due to the large number of
guests that wait around in the area.  Guests in the Fortress are easily
recognised as they bear no uniform of the Children of the white and gold
servants' livery of the Fortress.  The hallway is decorated in ways similar
to the hallway to the south which leads away from the grand staircase and
waiting area and back towards the main hallway of the first floor and the
entrance hall.  Children of the Light enter and exit this area, gathering
guests to guide them to their appointments or meetings without them straying
from where they should be.  The area just to the west is made up of a number
of comfortable looking chairs, set aside for the comfort of those awaiting a
guide to their appointment.  To the north the hallway continues leading
ultimately towards the magnificent main staircase of this floor.

the magnificent sight of the first floor staircase.

Standing out of the way of the main hallway in a waiting hall~
This small area has been set aside for guests to stand and confer or wait
without getting in the way of Children of the Light or servants needing to
use the hallway to the east.  The uses of these areas are obvious due to the
large number of guests that wait around in the area.  Guests in the Fortress

area set aside for waiting guests, the different being this area has a large

hallway leading from the grand staircase to the main entrance to this level

The area here has been designated as a small sitting area for guests that
may need to sit down if they plan on waiting a long time for their

An elaborate staircase leading upwards further into the Fortress~
This staircase here has vast amounts of time and thought put into its
design and creation.  The rails of the staircase have been carefully carved
into delicate shapes.  At the very top of the staircase on the wall behind,
a large Golden Sunburst of the Children of the Light has been set, seeming
as if its glorious light shines down the staircase.  The staircase has been
divided into two sections, the sections split up by a landing which sits
just above this section.  Each step of the staircase has been set in a
marble as pure as the cloaks the Children of the Light wear, set into the
marble on the landing there is another sunburst of the Children.  The
staircase leads upwards towards the second floor of the Fortress.  Back to
the south the hallway returns through the waiting area towards the main
entrance of the first floor of the Fortress.

This highly decorated corridor traverses the First floor of the Fortress
leading in most directions, mainly towards the west or east.  It passes
various closed doors on its route, doors which lead into the offices and
waiting rooms of this floor.  The walls of the hallway are a dull white and

placed at different intervals through out the floor.  The hallway is rather
empty, it seems that few children loiter on this level, as there are only a
few offices here, the more important areas are situated on the higher
floors.  At either the end of the western and eastern hallway the corridor
bends moving north towards one of the two side entrances to this floor and
the offices located in that vicinity.  The main entrance lies back along the
hallway.  The crossroads of this floor lie just to the west, allowing access
to the staircase leading upwards and the main entrance of this level in the
Fortress.  Just to the north lies a closed door that seems to lead into a
small office of unknown purpose.

The main entrance of this level lies westwards while to the east the hallway
bends north.

Barracks area assigned to those units on permanent garisson in the Fortress
of the Light.  There is a small room almost hidden from sight to the west, a
slight scent of flowers and herbs mixed together seems to waft in from the
room.

A small room of the corridor decorated in silk~
This room off the main corridor is dressed in different colored silks,
colors such as white, yellow and even red.  The only piece of furniture here
is a small table, which holds a vase of pretty flowers that seem rather
fresh.  Without a door or seats of any kind this room cannot really be a
waiting room.  Perhaps it serves as a short-term waiting room, for those
guests who do not expect to be waiting long, or perhaps not, the real
function of the room cannot be told.  Few people seem to even know of this
room's existence, the majority move on by with little care of what is around
them or some are just too busy to even glance in its direction.  A sweet
scent of pollen and blossom wafts gently through the area, it mixes well
with another scent, a scent of some sort of spice or herb, which has been
hidden from view.

The reception of a large office~
This reception area is rather large; it has seating for around ten
people.  The offices located here belong to the Task Master, Courier and
Paymaster of the Fortress of the Light.  The seating provided here looks of
rather high quality and also looks strangely comfortable, perhaps there is
usually a long wait to see the Paymaster or even the Task Master.  Each
office is located in a separate room closed of from the other neighbouring
office, though the only way to get to the courier's office is via either the
Paymaster or Task Master's office.  The ornate oak door to the north leads
into the Task Master's office while the door to the west leads into the
offices of the Paymaster of the Fortress.  The only other door here leads
back into he corridor of the first floor of the Fortress which is to the
south.

The task officer's office~
This medium sized office belongs to the Task Master of the Children of
the Light.  The job of Task Master is a rather strange and not easy one, it
is his duty to organise and see to it that the Fortress of the Light is run
smoothly and without error.  Should an Officer wish something to be arranged
or carried out that is not military then it is organised by the Task
Officer, banquets are the main use of the officer though he also arranges
meetings of officers and even the Council of Anointed at times.  The office
consists of a large desk, a oak panelled book case, a bronze plaque bearing
the name of he owner of the office, and a large wooden and comfortable
looking chair sat behind the desk.  There are two doors in this office, one
to the south and one to the west.  The western door leads into the offices
of the Fortress' Courier, the southern door leads back out into the
reception area of the three offices located here.

The Courier's room~
The office here is used by the Fortress' Courier.  The job of the courier
is simple, packages or messages may be delivered to the office with orders
pending their destination and time of arrival.  The courier must then
organise the safe passage of these messages or packages, in some cases the
destination is somewhere internal, inside the Fortress, and in these cases
the Courier will do the delivery personally.  In other cases the courier may
send the message with a Company heading in that direction or via a single
mounted squadron.  The office itself is rather large and well organised, a
large pigeon whole setup takes up the northern wall, these pigeon holes are
used by the Courier to organise his messages and deliveries.  There are two
doors in the office one on either side of the Courier's large and tidy desk,
the door to the east leads into the Task Master's office while the door to
the south leads into the paymaster's office.  A bronze plaque on the desk
displays the name of the current owner of this office.

A large office suited to the taste of the Paymaster~
This rather large office serves as a work place for the Children's
Paymaster.  His job is to simply trade the pay slips that are handed out for
small or large, depending on rank, pouches of gold coins or marks.  This
must be one of the more frequently visited offices in the Fortress as it
serves such as vital role.  The poor secretary that works I these offices
must have a hard time making appointments and allowing Children of the Light
into the office.  This office block is positioned on the eastern side of the
first floor, well placed next to the side entrance, which leads into the
barracks for the troopers.  The office itself is well furnished with a large
desk behind which is an equally large and comfortable looking chair.  A
small wooden filling cabinet serves the Paymaster, placed in easy reach of
the desk and chair.  The desk is covered with slips and parchments of
various kinds, quite a bundle.  A slight scent of tobacco ligers I the air,
obviously one of the Paymaster's favorite past times is smoking his pipe.

An expansive waiting room~
Hidden from view of the main hallway of the first floor of the fortress
is this rather expansive room, which serves as a waiting room for guests
visiting the fortress.  A large variety of furniture is spread throughout
the room, furniture ranging from long sofas to small yet plush armchairs. 
In the center of the room there is a small table at about knee height which
serves as a table for placing cups of mulled wine or hot kaf.  There are two
doors leading into and out of this room both are on the southern wall of the
room, one on the western edge one on the eastern one.  A guard will
occasionally enter the room to escort a guest to his/her destination but
other than that and the small talk that tends to take place between the
guests the room seems to remain rather quiet.

A small office~
Behind the closed door of the hallway is this small office, it is
strangely placed on the first floor as the majority of offices on this level
are grouped together while this one is alone, surrounded by waiting rooms
and other such areas.  The office is rather standard, desk, chair, failing
cabinet, and wall ornament and all are made from simple wood.  Yet something
about this office makes it seem friendly and not at all boring.  What this
is it is hard to tell, it may be the offices' location or even the man that
works here.  A small bronze plaque on the desk holds the owner's name and
position within the Children.  The main hallway of the first floor lies to
the south, through the closed door.

The stone corridor leads west~
This highly decorated corridor traverses the First floor of the Fortress
leading in most directions, mainly towards the west or east.  It passes
various closed doors on its route, doors which lead into the offices and
waiting rooms of this floor.  The walls of the hallway are a dull white and
beneath the layer of white is the smooth, cool to the touch, stone that the
walls are made from.  The drab corridors with their plain white walls are
brightened up through the use of tapestries, shields and runners of silk
placed at different intervals through out the floor.  The hallway is rather
empty, it seems that few children loiter on this level, as there are only a
few offices here, the more important areas are situated on the higher
floors.  At either the end of the western and eastern hallway the corridor
bends moving north towards one of the two side entrances to this floor and
the offices located in that vicinity.  The main entrance lies back along the
hallway.  This part of the corridor leads west towards the bend in the
corridor which can seen in the distance and back to the main entrance to the
east.

A new corridor leading east~
Just off the end of the main corridor, runs this small and likewise stone
corridor.  The corridor is short ending nearby to the east but even though
it may be short, a carpet runs the full length and width of it, a rather
rare sight in the Fortress.  The walls of the corridor are made of stone and
are a dull shade of white, a too common occurance here.  Back to the west is
the end of the main corridor, leading into the Gardens or back into the
Fortress while to the east is the end of the corridor and a closed door from
the looks of it.

The corridor ends before a closed door~
The stone corridor that branched off earlier ends here, just before a
wooden door leading into what a sign says is the joint office's of the
Provisional Officer and the Section Officer.  The entrance to the offices is
the oak door to the north, its heavy face carved and inlaid with various
designs, spicing up the otherwise dull corridor.  The floor is fully
carpeted, a light red carpet covering both the length and the wide of the
corridor's floor, Due to this corridor being situated away from the main
corridor, the level of noise here is considerably less than elsewhere on
this level.  The corridor returns to the main one back to the west while a
closed door is to the north.

A reception area for this office~
Judging from the size of the room and the two doors to the north and
west, these offices seem rather spacious.  This room is somewhat plain,
lacking furniture of anysort, save the two doors west and north, as well as
the doors, a sign hangs on the wall detailing the occupants of the office. 
The room and surrounding rooms are quiet and peacefull, a lucky feature to
have in one's office.  The walls of this room are white, a common color in
the Fortress not suprisingly, and being white, the light in the room bounces
off the walls casting a shadow on the far wall.  The air here is rather
fresh, slightly scented with what seem to smell like pine tree leaves, maybe
used to freshen the air or maybe just present by accident.

The provisional Officer's study and office~
This office, beloning to the Provisional Officer, in charge of the
supplies, mainly food supplies, for the Fortress of the Light is rather
small.  Only having in it a simple oak desk and a set of drawers tucked away
into the corner of the room, away from either of the two doors.  The walls
of the office are plain white, not decorated and unique to the other rooms
in the office, the floor here is carpeted by a blue carpet fringed in red. 
The exits are back to the west and to the south A small bronze plaque on
this desk holds the name and position of the owner of this office.

The Section Officer's office~
This office belongs to the Section Officer of the Fortress of the Light,
the man responsible for all the dealings with rooms and room assignments in
the fortress, quite a task considering the actual size of the Fortress.  The
The room as with the rest of the large office is silent, almost eerily
silent making the room both a pleasant work environment and an ideal place
for an un-disturbed slumber.  This room is well decorated, including a
wooden desk and a large tapestry depicting the Fortress of the Light proudly
watching over Amador.  The top half of the walls in the office are decorated
in bright colors of yellow and white, while the bottom half are plain white.
This white is again used on the slightly curved ceiling and it's supporting
arches, which bare different carvings of different designs.  To the north is
a closed door leading into another room, while to the east is the door
leading back out of the office.  A small plaque on this desk holds the name
and position of the owner of this office.

A documents room for the two offices~
The document room is not very large but the majority of its space is
taken up by the wooden filing store in which documents from the surrounding
offices are stored, only those people working in the adjoining offices have
access to this room and anyone wishing to get in here must first go through
either of the two offices.  Exits are to the east and to the south.  As with
the rest of the office this room is quiet, maybe even the quietest of them
all shame it is only used to store documents and not to catch up on lost
sleep.

design and creation.  The rails of the staircase have been carefully carved
into delicate shapes.  At the very top of the staircase on the wall behind,
a large Golden Sunburst of the Children of the Light has been set, seeming
as if its glorious light shines down the staircase.  The staircase has been
divided into two sections, the sections split up by a landing which sits
just above this section.  Each step of the staircase has been set in a
marble as pure as the cloaks the Children of the Light wear, set into the
marble on the landing there is another sunburst of the Children.  Here on
the landing, the staircase continues to the north while it leads back down

The Second floor of the Fortress~
The second floor of the Fortress of the Light is strangely small.  It
serves as an area for quarters for those that rank high in the Children, men
such as the Lieutenants or Hundredmen in charge of large numbers of men.  As
well as the plush officer quarters, there is a small office designated area,
which is at the end of one of the small hallways that break of this main
hallway.  The walls of this hallway, and the other hallways that break off
it, are made from a rather plain white stone, this stone gives the corridor
a rather dull appearance.  In order to brighten up the vista, large and
well-polished shields have been mounted on the walls of the hallway and
regular intervals, each shield bears the brilliant sunburst of the Children
of the Light.  This hallway passes though this floor, leading to and fro
from each of the three staircases located here.  Other than those Children
coming to this floor to visit the quarters or offices, the main use of this
floor is to provide access to the upper-levels.  Here, dwarfing the
staircase is a large sunburst of the Children of the Light, set into the
wall which faces the staircase.  The staircase leads down to the first
floor, while to the east the hallway continues through the second floor of
the Fortress.

A staircase leading upwards~
The staircase here leads upwards to the third floor of the Fortress.  The
staircase itself is rather simple in design, it allows access for a large
number of people at the same time, such is required due to the large number
of people who need to reach the top floors of the Fortress.  The walls of
the staircase here are made of the same material as the hallway which passes
by the staircase to the south; smooth and rather plain white stone.  The
only decoration here other than the staircase are a pair of Gleaming white
shields bearing the sunburst of the Children of the Light which are mounted
one on either side of the staircase as it ascends.  To the south the hallway
returns through the second floor.

Nearing a bend in the main hallway~
The second floor of the Fortress of the Light is strangely small.  It
serves as an area for quarters for those that rank high in the Children, men
such as the Lieutenants or Hundredmen in charge of large numbers of men.  As
well as the plush officer quarters, there is a small office designated area,
which is at the end of one of the small hallways that break of this main
hallway.  The walls of this hallway, and the other hallways that break off
it, are made from a rather plain white stone, this stone gives the corridor

leading to the north and south, just to the south, the corridor bends. 
There is a closed door here to the west, he door leads into a large office
of some description.

A stairwell on the second floor leading up~
The staircase here leads upwards to the third floor of the Fortress.  The
staircase itself is rather simple in design, it allows access for a large
number of people at the same time, such is required due to the large number
of people who need to reach the top floors of the Fortress.  The walls of
the staircase here are made of the same material as the hallway which passes
by the staircase to the south; smooth and rather plain white stone.  The
only decoration here other than the staircase are a pair of Gleaming white
shields bearing the sunburst of the Children of the Light which are mounted
one on either side of the staircase as it ascends.  Back to the north lies
the hallway which runs through this level of the Fortress.

A large office~
The office here is setup for the use of two ranking officers in the
Children of the Light.  One of the offices belongs to a Lord Captain, the
Lord Captain is privileged enough to have his own secretary to organise his
work for him and help where possible.  This room is used as a simple
entrance hall for the set of offices, those who wish to see either of the
officers have to knock and wait here for their summons.  The door to the
north leads into one of the offices here, belonging to a normal ranked
officer.  To the west is the reception of the Lord Captain's office, where
the receptionist waits to handle visitors and guests.  The door to the east
leads out of these offices and back into the second floor of the Fortress.

to the north behind the door.  A secretary sits here in this room, assigned
to the Lord Captain to help organise his meetings and appointments and even
handle messages which need to be delivered either to the Lord Captain or to
someone else from the Lord Captain.  The reception area here is rather well
furnished, there are seats for those waiting as well as a filing cabinet,
desk and chair for the Lord Captain's secretary.  On the walls of this area
here are great tapestries depicting brilliant acts of the Children of the
Light.  The door to the north leads into the Lord Captain's office while the
tall archway to the east leads back into the reception area and entrance of
the offices.

An office belonging to a ranking officer~
This office has been specifically built and set aside for the sole use of
one of the ranking officers of the Children of the Light.  That could be any
officer from the rank of Hundredman to Lord Captain.  The office has a
rather simple layout with a range of different pieces of furniture.  There
is a wooden desk set in the middle of the room facing the southern door,
behind the desk there is a large high-backed chair for the use of the
officer who owns this office.  Sitting along the eastern wall in reach of
the desk is a small bookcase for documents and books belonging to the owner
of this office.  The door to the west leads into the second office belonging
to a Lord Captain, the other door, to the south, leads back into the
reception area for this office.  There is a plaque on the table holding the
name of the owner of this office.

This large office has been built and assigned to one of the important
Lord Captains of the Children of the Light.  The office furniture consists
of a very large wooden desk set in the corner of the room with an equally
large chair sat behind the desk for the sole use of the Lord Captain.  As
well as the desk and chair there is a bookcase and a filing cabinet beside
the desk to store documents and book for the Lord Captain.  In front of the
desk there is a pair of low backed cushioned chairs, used to allow visitors
of the Lord Captain to have a seat while in meeting with him.  The door to
the east leads into the other office in this set of Offices while the door
to the south leads back into the reception area of the Lord Captain's
office.  There is a small bronze plaque on the desk holding the name of the
Lord Captain that owns this office.

A plush set of quarters~
The quarters located here, on the second floor of the Fortress, have been
assigned to one lucky officer who is currently assigned to the Fortress of
the Light.  This room acts as both a small sitting room and study for the
officer.  The sitting room area sits just next to the door leading into
these quarters.  The study consists of a medium sized desk set in the corner
of the room complete with chair and bookcase.  To the west there is another
door which leads into the bedchamber of these quarters.  The door back to
the east leads out of the quarters back onto the corridor of the second
floor of the Fortress.

The bed chamber of the room, complete with bath~
Strangely enough this medium sized room seems to be kept in neat and
orderly fashion, a fashion very common among military men who are share a
love for tidy and neatness.  This bed chamber is rather plush, plush enough
that it is reserved for the use of an Officer not just any soldier.  The
furniture in the room consists mainly of a large bed set against the western
wall; the bed has been very neatly made with no sign of creases of any sort
on the cover.  Beside the bed there is a small chest of drawers for storing
clothes while next to it there is a larger wardrobe for storing hanging
clothes such as dress uniform.  There are some wooden pegs next the wardrobe
for hanging cloaks and tabards on.  To the east sits the small sitting room
and study area of these quarters as well as the entrance to the room.

The entrance to a set of Quarters~
The entrance to these quarters has been well decorated making the
countenance of the room rather inviting and warming.  These quarters must
belong to a ranked officer in the Children as only an officer could afford
the lush decorations used through out this room.  As well as the tapestries
and flowers decorating what must be a small sitting room there is also a
large mannequin standing just between the low down doorway into the
bedchamber and study of these quarters.  The mannequin has been dressed in
an ornate suit of shining armour, it looks very much like it has been custom
made for battle.  The officer who owns these quarters obviously has no use
for his battle armour when not in the saddle or in the field, hence it being
left on a mannequin.  To the west is a small doorway which leads into the
sleeping area of these quarters.  The door to the east leads back out of the
quarters, onto the second floor of the Fortress.

The sleeping chamber of the quarters~
The room here has been carefully scented using exotic herbs of some sort,
these herbs give the air a light and inviting aura, perfect for sleep or for
working without becoming distracted.  There is a rather large soldiers bed
in the corner of the room, the bed's covers are of a dark red colour, close
to scarlet.  Next to the bed is a chest of drawers for clothing and other
such items, as well as the chest of drawers for clothing, there is also a
tall cupboard in the opposite corner of the room, the cupboard is rather
wide and can hold a large number of clothing items.  Hidden in the corner of
the room next to the door is the desk and cabinet which make up the study of
these quarters.  Having the desk hidden from view from the sitting room of
these quarters may not be good for security but must help in getting work
done undisturbed.  The doorway to the east leads back into the sitting room
of these plush, officer quarters.

A cosy set of quarters~
These quarters are not overly large but the have an extremely warming
and cosy feeling to them.  The Officer who owns these quarters has obviously
put a lot of his pay into making the quarters just what he wants them to be.
This room has been set out as a sitting room and study.  There are a few
lounging chairs scattered around the room, they form a rough L shape around
a small low down table set for placing drinks upon.  Away from the table and
its entourage of chairs, in the corner of the room there is a large oak
desk, the desk is accompanied by a large, high backed chair.  Obviously this
is where the owner of these quarters gets what work he needs to do done. 
There is a brilliant gleaming metal shield mounted above the desk, its face
emblazoned with a burning sun flare of the Children of the Light.  On the
far side of the room there is a large pennant, also of the Children of the
Light.  To the west there is a doorway into the bedroom area of these
quarters.  The door to the east leads out of these quarters and back onto
the corridor leading through the second floor of the Fortress.

A bedroom and relaxing room~
Compared to the rather large sitting room and study area back through the
doorway to the east, this room is rather small in comparison.  Where it
lacks in size it makes up in ambience, the room seems to carry an extremely
comforting air to it.  The main contents of the room are the large four
poster bed in the dead centre of the room as well as the large row of
dressing cupboards and drawers.  There is also some sort of reclining couch
hidden view of the Sitting room, obviously another place for the owner of
these quarters to rest when off duty.  The spoils of an Officer in the
Children of the Light are extremely apparent in the decoration of these
quarters, a filled Liqueur cabinet sits next to the reclining bench complete
with goblet.  Mounted at various points through out the room are memorabilia
of the Children of the Light.  The exit from these quarters lies further,
back to the east, in the form of a large oak door.

On a small corridor ~
The second floor of the Fortress of the Light is strangely small.  It
serves as an area for quarters for those that rank high in the Children, men
such as the Lieutenants or Hundredmen in charge of large numbers of men.  As
well as the plush officer quarters, there is a small office designated area,
which is at the end of one of the small hallways that break of this main
hallway.  The walls of this hallway, and the other hallways that break off
it, are made from a rather plain white stone, this stone gives the corridor
a rather dull appearance.  In order to brighten up the vista, large and
well-polished shields have been mounted on the walls of the hallway and
regular intervals, each shield bears the brilliant sunburst of the Children
of the Light.  This hallway passes though this floor, leading to and fro
from each of the three staircases located here.  Other than those Children
coming to this floor to visit the quarters or offices, the main use of this
floor is to provide access to the upper-levels.  This small corridor which
breaks of the main hallway leads east towards a set of doors, back to the
west the main hallway of the second floor of the Fortress of the Light runs.

The small area here is boxed in between a pair of doors one to the north
the other to the south.  There are a few chairs dotted around this room set
aside for those waiting to enter either of the offices located in this area.
The offices here belong to the Documentarian and the Capital Chief for the
Fortress of the Light.  Those waiting for meetings with either officer must
knock then wait here in this room until called upon.  The room is rather
well decorated, with small wall pictures and colourful runners of silk
covering the surrounding walls adding to the bright cheerful atmosphere of
these offices.  The door to the west leads out of the offices back to the
main hallway of the Second floor of the Fortress.

The study of the documentarian~
The role of the Documentarian is an extremely important one in the
Fortress of the Light.  Any and ever important document which needs to be
stored or filed safely is handed over to the care of the Documentarian.  The
small wooden door to the west leads into the document room, a vast room full
of cabinets and shelves for storing file upon file upon file of paper and
parchment.  The Documentarian' office is not that large, consisting only of
a desk, chair and filling cabinet, other than the furniture there are a few
decorations dotted around the room, most of which pertain to the Children of
the Light in one way or another.  The only other door in the room is to the
south, its leads back out of this office into the waiting room.

The office of the Capital Chief~
From within this office the mood changes from the light and cheerful mood
conveyed by the bright decorations to a more serious mood conveyed from the
contents of the office here.  The desk is neatly kept with a stack of papers
on one side of the desk, carefully placed in an orderly presentation. 
Behind the desk is a wooden, high-backed chair for use by the Capital Chief
of the Fortress.  It is the job of the Capital Chief to hold a stock of all
the funds held by the Children of the Light at any one time.  He stores some
of these funds in the safe to the west, the other lot is kept in an
undisclosed area of the Fortress.  The Capital Chief is a member of the
Council of Anointed and hence is brought in on the meetings of the heads of
the Children to decide on what action needs to be taken when something takes
place.  The door to the north leads out of this office and back into the
waiting area of these offices.

The guarded entrance to the guest quarters~
The entrance to the guest quarters is a pair of large oak doors, carved
with intricate text of unknown meaning.  The doors stand about eight feet
tall, tall enough for most men and ogier a like.  The entrance is guarded,
though not heavily, by a pair of Children, one of them obviously the officer
due to his lightning bolt adorned cloak.  Surprisingly he seems to be the
younger of the pair.  Both wear swords by their sides and both seem eager to
prevent entry into the guest quarters.  Through the doors the rest of the
elaborate guest quarters lie, a small wide hallway can be seen leading
deeper into the quarters.  Multiple doors can also be seen along the hallway
in some sereal way resembling a prison.  Various decorations can be see up
and down the corridor making look rather pretty from here.

A corridor through the guest quarters~
Beyond the large oak doors starts this long corridor.  The brightly
coloured corridor leads far to the east running the length of the first
floor of the guest quarters.  Apart from the various guards around the floor
few other non-children can be seen, the majority are either out or confined
to their rooms.  The walls of of the corridor are broken at various

hallway is a beautifull runner of silk that runs the distance of the guest
quarters.

A corridor through the guest quarters~
The long corridor continues east leading straight to a stairwell up.  The
brightly coloured corridor leads far to the east running the length of the
first floor of the guest quarters.  Apart from the various guards around the
floor few other non-children can be seen, the majority are either out or
confined to their rooms.  The walls of of the corridor are broken at various
intervals by wooden doors, doors that lead into the numerous rooms in the
guest quarters.  Between each door sits a tapestry each one depicting
different scenes be it battle, people, countries.  Also decorating the

A crossroad in the guest quarters~
The corridor here is broken by another short hallway one leading north,
one leading south.  To the east and west the main corridor continues, west
leading back to the entrance to the guest quarters and east to the end of
the hallway and the staircase leading to the upper levels.  The corridors
that lead in all cardinal directions have many doors lining their walls,
each door is decorated slightly and each door has between them some form of
furniture, the odd table with a flowers on them or a hanging tapestry
depicting great victories or famous leaders.  Apart from the various guards
around the floor few other non-children can be seen, the majority are either
out or confined to their rooms.  The air seems to have a light smell of
perfume, the majority of the noble guests must be made up of woman either
that or the rooms nearest this crossroads are.

Continuing along a hallway in the guest quarters~
The corridor continues, leading in both directions, the east and the
west.  Back to the west, the entrance to the great guest quarters lies
guarded by two Children of the light while to the east is the end of the
corridor and the staircase leading to the upper levels.  The corridor and
its walls are decorated wonderfully, covered in tapestries and silk runners.
Along the corridor are a vast number of doors, each door inlaid and carved
majestically and each door different.  Apart from the various guards around
the floor few other non-children can be seen, the majority are either out or
confined to their rooms.  The air seems to have a light smell of perfume,

Along a hallway in the guest quarters~
The corridor runs east and west, ending just to the east in a bend that
leads to a staircase up to the upperlevels.  To the far west lies the two
massive doors that mark the entrance to the guest quarters, guarded by the
Children of the Light.  The hallway is made brighter by quality and sheer
number of decorations that adorn the walls and ceiling.  Along the walls at
various points are great tapestries depicting either famous battle scenes or
famous Children of the Light, along both the roof and some parts of the
hall's wall runs a runner of pretty silk.  Apart from the various guards

The hallway branches south~
The main corridor ends here in a plain, wall.  Back to the west, the long
hallway runs leading to the massive, guarded doors of the Guest quarters. 
The entire hallway is decorated with runners of silk, flowers and various
tapestries.  They add to the cleaness of the area and make it seem more
friendly and happy.  A small hallway branches off to the south leading to a
large marble staircase that spirals up to the floors above.  Apart from the
various guards around the floor few other non-children can be seen, the
majority are either out or confined to their rooms.  The air seems to have a

Just to the north off the crossroads breaks this small decorated hallway.
It leads north merging with an exterior stone corridor leading into another
building, along the hallway are two sets of doors.  One to the west and one
to the east, both doors are almost indentical, leading into different rooms
in the guest quarters.  Each door is carved from wood and each door is
inlaid with intricate carvings to make them more eye appealing.  Down this
branch from the hallway there are no guards and no guests, either the guests
are in their rooms or else where.  The only guarded hallway is the main one
back to the north that runs the length of the guest quarter's A faint smell
of some sort of perfume seems to waft here, more than obviously coming from
one of the rooms to either the east or the west.

The sitting room of the room~
This room is pleasant looking, colorful walls with matching furniture
create a clean and tidy ambience.  The furniture is simple, consisting of a
long sofa and next to it in the corner of the room a wooden rocking chair. 
There is only one door in this room although they are two exits, the door
sits to the south and leads back into the guarded corridor of the Guests
Quarters.  The exit to the north leads into what seems to be the bed chamber
of the room, a room which consists of a large bed and a dressing table.

A spacious bedroom~
This bedroom is lit by two closed lanterns, one mounted on the wall above
the entrance to the room and the other on the dressing table within reach of
the large bed here.  The sheer amount of space in the room is quite
surprising but the space is filled up by the furniture in the room, a large
bed and near to it, lying against the wall, a wooden dressing table.  A
slight scent of perfume floats about the room, maybe the room was last used
by a woman, or the room was scented to make it more comfortable.  The exit
to the south leads back into the sitting room of the quarters and beyond it
is the tall door that leads into the corridor.

With the main hallway out of sight, this branch of it seems duller, no
decorations, no tapestries and most noticably no guards.  The eloquent
marble staircase to the south stands out, illuminating the small corridor
with its beauty.  The marble staircase spirals up to the floors above, as
the level gets higher the rank of nobility also gets greater, with the high
class 'guests' on the higest floors.

Here, at the end of the short branch off the main hallway sits a
magnificant marble spiral staircase.  The staircase spirals upwards into the
upper levels of the guest quarters, and as the levels get higher as does the
heirarchy, the greater the levels, the higher the noble rank.  With the top
floor of the Guest quarters inhabited by those High Lords and High Ladys.

Leading onto a short hallway~
The hallway here allows passage in three directions to both the north,
south and west.  To the west, the hallway leads into another, one more
decorated and generally brighter and more interesting than this one, the
corridor there leads through this floor of the guest quarters heading
towards two of the larger guest quarters as well as the Guards barracks.  To
the north the hallway is rather bare and leads only a short distance to a
rather narrow spiral staircase which climbs upwards to some of the higher
floor of this building.  The hallway also continues back to the south,
leading back to the main staircase of the Guest quarters which allows access
back, down to the first level.  A sweet scent seems to linger in the air on
this floor of the guest quarters, the smell more than obviously coming from
the various flower collections that have been arranged though out this
corridor.

Before a pair of doors, north and south~
This short hallway is rather well guarded, it is continually patrolled by
armed Children of the Light who reside in one of the two guard stations
along this corridor with doors boarding the northern and southern wall.  At
the end of the corridor, not a long distance to the west, there is a large
wooden door, the door has its own guard who watches cautiously over the
people who walk this level.  The door leads into one of the two larger guest
chambers set aside for the more important 'guests'.  Decorating this
corridor has been a task not taking easily, the otherwise plain white stone
walls have been decorated using golden wall-lamps mounted at regular spacing
along the corridor, as well as this there are various collections of
flowers, added to improve the countenance and smell of the floor.  The
common runners of yellow and white entwined silk have also been used; these
run at both roof and floor level.  The corridor continues here to the west
and east, with the two guard stations entrances just to the north and south.

A hidden alcove~
This small yet rather tall alcove is hidden from the rest of the chamber
in the Dome of Truth by a simple white marble column that rises the full
length from marble floor to roof.  The alcove is wide enough to fit quite a
large amount of people, stretching almost two spans across and eight spans
up almost to the pure white ceiling.  As it is well hidden from the rest of
the chambers, the alcove makes the perfect meeting spot for members of the
Hand of the Light that frequent the chamber, basking in the true beauty of
the Dome of Truth.  A gold leaf shadow half bathes this alcove, coming
directly from the thousands of lamps that hang near the roof of the Dome
itself, reflecting its gold surface, shining down rays of golden light which
makes the entire chamber look even more spectacular.  This alcove like all
the other is dominated by a large tapestry depicting a scene from the
history of the Children of the Light, whether it be a battle won for the
Light or a Darkfriend hung for betraying the light.

Before another door leading north~
The bright hallway continues to the west leading further into the second
floor, just to the west the hallway disappears around a bend and also to the
west a medium sized door sits ending the hallway.  The door to the north is
nothing like that just to the west, to the north the door is rather small
and plain while the one to the west has carvings on it, and what looks like
a large sunburst inlaid on it.  The hallway like the others in the guest
quarters is eye appealing, decorated with tapestries, flowers and runners of
silk.  Unlike the other hallways in the barracks, the Children's presence
here is noticable the odd guard here and there and no guests in sight.  The
corridor returns east, leading back to the guard posts and the staircase.

Just to the west is a heavily carved and ornate door inlaid with the
golden sunburst of the Children of the Light.  The door leads into one of
the two large apartment type quarters here in the guest quarters.  The two
larger quarters are used for important guests or guests with a large
retinue.  The hallway like the others in the guest quarters is eye
appealing, decorated with tapestries, flowers and runners of silk.  Unlike
the other hallways in the Guest quarters, the Children's presence here is
noticeable the odd guard here and there and no guests in sight.  The
corridor returns east, leading back to the guard posts and the staircase. 
Just to the north the corridor branches leading only a small distance to the
north before it stops suddenly before another ornate and inlaid door, the
second large apartment on this floor.

The end of the hallway~
The small break off the hallway to the south ends here with a heavily
decorated door to the west.  The door has been cleverly inlaid with the
golden sunburst of the Children of the Light.  The door leads into the
second of the two larger guest rooms reserved for special guests.  The
hallway here is usually heavily guarded by Children of the Light, under the
command of the Commander of the Guest Quarters, currently Fairrel Muthat. 
His strict guard disciplines mean that the two doors here that lead into
these large guest rooms are constantly under guard.  Whether the guard are
there to keep an eye on the guests or protect them can only be known by
Child Muthat.  Back to the south the hallway stops before the second guarded
set of rooms on this floor and the hallway also links up with the main
hallway which traverses this floor.

Servants Quarters~
In this small room, various servants sit around.  In the middle of the
group stands a well dressed gentleman, obviously incharge of the servants
here.  There are a large variety of servants in the room, ranging from old
to young, from new to experienced and of both sexes.  Around the room there
are a few bunk beds in the corners, a large round table in the middle and a
dressing stand occupying the western wall.  The room is cut off from the
rest of the guest quarters by the large wooden door which sits just to the
south.

A well manned guard post~
This small barracks type room has been setup as a Guard Post for this
floor of the Guest Quarters.  The guards who patrol this floor use this room
as a resting and off-duty area.  There are a few bunks set up on the far
southern wall for resting between duty and in the centre of the room there
sits a small circular table surrounded by chairs.  The large number of empty
glasses occupying the table in the centre of the room seems to indicate that
Guards may be allowed to drink in their off duty time.  There is also a
weapons and armour rack on the western wall, Guards going onto duty pick up
their appropriate equipment and suit up before heading through the doors to
the north which lead out, onto the second floor of the Guest Quarters.

The entrance of a large plush room~
This room sits right at the entrance of this set of quarters, it is
simple used as an entrance hall will few decorations.  The plain white walls
and Children of the Light decorations make the room rather plain compared to
the rest of the Guest Quarters.  The decorations are in place to remind the
occupants of the room where they are and who they are guests to.  The ornate
door to the east leads back, out of these rooms and into the corridor
leading along the second floor of the Guest Quarters.  Just to the south
sits a small hallway, complete with hat-stand, the hallway is the linking
room between the important areas of these quarters.

The hallway of the room~
This hallway is the main link between the entrance to these rooms and the
rest of the rooms.  The hallway is used by guests to store cloaks, coats,
hats and other items that may be needed when leaving the room, sometimes
Armsmen who are allowed to remain armed leave their swords hanging over the
cloak stand.  The western corridor leads into a large meeting room equipped
with a grand table and a large number of comfortable looking chairs.  The
hallway to the north leads back to the entranceway of the rooms.  The other
open hallway to the south leads into a cosy looking sitting room where
guests can sit and relax when they have free time.  The air in this set of
rooms seems slightly scented by some kind of local flower, another added
feature of these rooms.

A large cosy sitting room~
The large number of comfortable sofas and chairs that have been carefully
arranged here, in this room, give off a warm and inviting atmosphere.  The
room has been provided to guests who manage to find a spare moment to sit
down and enjoy a hot cup of kaf as a break from all their work whether
diplomatic or otherwise.  There are enough chairs in this room for at least
ten people maybe even more.  The hallway leading just to the north from this
room leads back to the hallway and beyond to the entrance hall.  The doorway
to the west leads into a private and quiet study allowing guests to work on
whatever they may need to work on.

A formal, luxurious study~
With books pilled high on the study desk in the middle of this room it
seems that guests make frequent use of this room.  A small library of books
rests on a bookcase at the far back of the room, the shelves only half full
of books.  The desk seems to be made of one piece of wood; this gives it
away as the Ogier Crafted Sungwood a very rare and very strong wood.  There
is a large wooden chair covered in plush cushions behind the desk for the
use of a guest while hard at work.  The only light in this room is thrown
down from the two wall lights mounted three quarters of the way up on the
western and eastern walls.  The door to the north leads into the large
meeting room while the smaller door to the west leads into the master
bedroom of these quarters.

An expansive bedchamber~
A large four poster bed takes up the large majority of the space in this
expansive bedchamber.  The bed is not the only piece of furniture in the
room however, there is also a large wardrobe on the eastern wall beside the
door and two sets of chest of drawers both on the southern wall.  Beside the
bed there is also a small table with a bedside candle holder with snuffer. 
The bed looks extremely comfortable with what seem to be warm and soft
covers and a very soft and fluffy base.  There are three exits from this
room, the eastern door leads into a private study, the western archway leads
into a small and secluded dressing room for the occupants of this
bedchamber.  The northern door leads into another small bedroom for guests
to sleep in.

Hidden here from the view of the main bedchamber is this rather small
dressing room.  The dressing room consists of a small dressing table
complete with mirror as well as a rather large cupboard at the rear of the
room for holding clothes and garments.  The dressing table has a small stool
before it allowing a guest to sit while getting themselves dressed and
presentable.  The bedchamber lies back to the east through the small arch.

A meeting room~
The meeting room here is made up of a massive, rectangular, oak table set
in the middle of the room.  Around the table are a large number of different
chairs, the chairs and the table leave just enough room for guests to reach
the door to the west by going around the table as well as the other door to
the south.  The western door seems to lead into a small bedroom while the
southern door leads into a closed off, private study set aside for the free
use of the guests.  The main use of this room is rather obvious, for holding
meetings either among a group of guests staying in the Fortress or with the
Guests and officials of the Children of the Light.  A large chandler hovers
over the middle of the table throwing down light on the meeting room and its
occupants.

A small room, a second bedroom~
This small room is used as a second bedroom for the guests staying here. 
The room has three small beds lining the northern wall allowing the retinue
of a guest somewhere to get some sleep.  The room is no where near as nice
as the master bedroom to the south, but it is better than nothing, the soft
mattresses being far more comfortable than the hard and well polished wooden
floor.  There is one large set of cupboards which takes up most of the
western wall, allowing just enough room to access the door to the south
which leads into the master bedroom.  The other door, to the east, leads
into the large meeting room.

and Children of the Light decorations make the room rather plain compared to

door to the east leads back, out of these rooms and into the corridor
leading along the second floor of the Guest Quarters.  This is the second
set of larger rooms on this floor, the other set lies somewhere to the
south.  To the north there is a rather comfortable looking room used mainly
by guests for receiving visitors, it is usually in that room that guests
post their own secretaries or guards.

A comfortable looking receiving room~
The receiving room here has been constructed with the comfort of its
occupants in mind.  The room consists of a few pieces of furniture and the
odd decoration.  The main piece of furniture is a large cloak stand in the
corner of the room, nearest to the entrance of these rooms.  The cloak stand
is used for a large range of uses, holding cloaks and shawls and even
scabbards and other weapons that may be needed when leaving the rooms. 
There is a door to the west, the door is not heavily decorated and seems to
lead into a rather large sitting room.  The hallway to the south returns to
the entrance of these rooms.

A large spacious sitting room~
This sitting room has been built in a rather large room, there are enough
sofas and comfortable looking chairs for around ten people, perhaps more. 
The room is set aside for guests to rest should they ever find time to do so
in their busy schedule.  A small low down table set in the middle of all the
sofas and chairs is in place for putting glasses or mugs down on should a
guest wish to rest and enjoy a nice warm kaf.  This sitting room is the main
link between the entrance to these rooms and the rest of the rooms here. 
There are three doors in this room, one to the west leading into a small
dormitory type bedroom, one to the south which leads into a quiet and
private study and one to the east, which leads into the receiving room of
these quarters.

This small bedroom is more used as a dormitory than a single bedroom. 
There are four beds here in this room, all put closely together and all
lining the northern wall, at the foot of each bed there is a large trunk for
the owner of the bed to put their belongings in.  There is only just about
enough space at the foot of the beds to reach the southern door which must
lead into the master bedroom of these rooms.  As well as the beds and chests
there is are a line of pegs on the western wall, used for hanging belongings
of the occupants of this room's beds.

There is a small wooden desk which sits against the far wall, the surface of
the desk is covered with books of all different sorts all taken from the
small library shelf that sits next to the desk.  As well as the shelf and
the desk there is a large and comfortable looking chair which, sits behind
the desk allowing the guest to sit comfortable while working.  The heavy-set

Here the hallway continues north, heading towards another staircase
which gives access to the higher levels of these Guest Quarters.  The
staircase to the north is a rather narrow yet well decorated and elaborate
staircase, it seems that the most important of guests reside on the top
floor of the Guest Quarters.  The commander of the Guard also has his
offices on the upper levels.  The hallway also continues back to the south,
leading back to the main staircase of the Guest quarters which allows access
back, down to the first level.  A sweet scent seems to linger in the air on
this floor of the guest quarters, the smell more than obviously coming from
the various flower collections that have been arranged though out this
corridor in an attempt to make the area seem more homely.

This spiral staircase is rather narrow, it seems to be of a rather old
design which was at some point re-done, the staircase has been heavily
decorated, the stone of the staircase has been given a layer of a smooth
purplish rock, most probably marble of some sort.  The walls of the
staircase, as it climbs upwards, have been decorated with silks and steel. 
White and Yellow coloured cloth has been hung on the walls at regular
intervals with Steel shields, each bearing a different coat of arms of a
nation placed in between each strip of cloth.  The hallway also continues
back to the south, leading back to the main staircase of the Guest quarters
which allows access back, down to the first level.  A sweet scent seems to

The third floor~
Here, the Third Floor of the Guest Quarters begins, the Spiral staircase
continues upwards as it climbs towards the highest tower of the building. 
To the south a short hallway begins, the hallway seems to be rather
important as there are various, armed, Children of the Light posted along
it.  The Third Floor of the Guest Quarters has been set aside for the most
important of Guests to the Fortress of the Light, in most cases this means
royalty from one of the many different Nations of the known world.  The
Captain of the Guard also has his offices on this level, they sit adjacent
to one of the guard barracks.  From the Captain of the Guard's Offices the
entire security for these Guest Quarters is sorted, should the alarm bells
go off, the Guest Quarters can be secured in minutes with guests detained in
their rooms.  The staircase also disappears downwards back down towards the
second floor of this building.

A short guarded hallway~
This small hallway does not run far, it leads both west and north, west
towards a pair of large Sungwood doors inlaid with magnificent carvings and
north, back to the main staircase.  Another door lies along the corridor
this one not as beautiful as the other.  The presence of guards on this
floor is made obvious by the second door, leading into a well manned guard
post more than likely, The Commander of the guard here resides on this floor
somewhere, maybe in the guard post.  Other than the doors, the hallway is
well decorated with a long curtain of red silk running along the tops of the
walls and a tapestry here and there.  Just before the doors to the west, a
small table rests and on it a vase sits occupied by a wonderful selection of
colourful flowers.  A sweet scent seems to linger in the air on this floor
of the guest quarters, the smell more than obviously coming from the various
flower collections that have been arranged though out this corridor.

Before a magnicant pair of doors~
Here the short hallway ends in a pair of doors, both doors have been
crafted from the expensive and unique Sungwood, as well as this the doors
have been carefully crafted using exotic designs, the northern door has a
blazing sunburst carved into it.  This hallway may be small but it is rather
important, its importance is displayed by the armed guards who keep a keen
eye on the occupants of the hallway, especially those who enter either of
the two doors here to the north or west.  The northern door marked with the
sunburst leads into a guard post and most likely also into the offices of
the Captain of the Guard of the Guest Quarters.  To the west, the doorway
leads into the largest and plushest of rooms in the Guest Quarters; the room
can support a group of around 10 people with ease and also includes its own
meeting room.  The hallway returns towards the staircase eastwards.

A guard post, before a large office~
This room acts as a rather large guard post for this level of the guest
quarters.  The majority of the space in this room is taken up by the pair of
bunk beds which have been constructed against the northern wall, these have
been put in place for off duty guards to get some rest between duty
assignments.  As well as the bunk beds there is also a large table set in
the south-western corner of the room, the table has various parchments
littering its top, the majority of them are guest lists, lists of those
guests currently residing in the Guest Quarters but there also guard duty
rosters for the Guards and other such documents.  There are two exits from
this guard post, the door to the south leads out into the hallway of the
Third floor while to the east there is another door which must lead into the
Office of the Captain of the Guard of the Guest Quarters.  Positioned
carefully next to the southern door is the weapons rack so that guards going
on duty can pick up their weapons just as they leave the room.

A large plush room's entrance~
These rooms have been set aside for the use of only the most important
guests in the Fortress, these guests receive the best accommodation,
personal guards, and the finest foods.  This room here is only the beginning
of the large apartment type quarters here allocate to these guests.  The
quarters consist of an expansive sitting room, various bed chambers, a
meeting room and private study.  The quarters have also been well decorated
using a variety of different schemes depending on the room.  There is
however a common appearance in the majority of rooms, these are the Gold
Leaf lanterns mounted high on the walls, these lanterns throw down more than
enough light to illuminate the rooms.  The closed door to the north leads
into the private meeting chamber which is decked out with flags from all the
different nations of the known world.  The door to the west leads into the
expansive sitting and dining area of these rooms while to the east, the
ornate door leads out of these rooms and back onto the main corridor of the
Third floor of the guest quarters.

The Commander of the Guest Quarters, office~
This first sight of this office is something rather special, the Captain
of the Guest Quarters has spent a long time adapting and decorating the room
to his rather unique taste.  The walls of the room are heavily decked out
with memorabilia of the Children of the Light, ranging from Sunburst
emblazon shields to Half moon Battle Axes.  The most impressive of these is
the Shienaran Hand and A Half Broadsword mounted horizontally on the western
wall above the door, the immense sword has had a blazing sunburst crafted
into the massive pommel of the blade.  The Captain has quite a collection of
torn battle Pennants obviously taken as trophies in various battles or
sorties.  The Eastern side of the room is dominated by the Captain's desk,
the desk and its immense chair would be better suited to an Ogier rather
than a Human.  Other than the desk and chair there are two low backed
cushioned chairs positioned in front of the desk, obviously put in place for
those who seek an audience with the Captain.  The door to the west leads out
of this office and back to the Guard Barracks.

Beneath the Gate~
Light beams in from above, bathing this area with golden sunshine, the
light here is of great contrast to the rest of the corridor to the east. 
The eastern corridor is dark and damp, wall-torches have been mounted on the
wall at a few intervals, not enough to give off enough light to keep this
corridor lighted.  The walls of the corridor are all in a bad state of decay
and disrepair; they give off the perfect look of this damp passageway
leading towards the prison cells.  As well as the lack of light there is a
faint fetid smell lingering in the air, must obviously coming from the
prisons located along the corridor.  This corridor does not seem to be
heavily traversed although the width of the corridor may seem to prove
otherwise.  Along the corridor at random interval there seem to be small
niches built into the side of the wall, they look like at one time in the
past they used as guard posts, their exact origin is not obvious from just
looking at them however.  The stone staircase leading upwards returns to the
surface, the only barrier between the light of the courtyard above and the
darkness of the prisons is a horizontal metal gate fixed into the ceiling
which prevents anyone from leaving while it remains locked.

The gate into the cell corridor~
The under-lighted corridor ends here with a large metal gate to the
south, the gate leads into the prison corridor of the Fortress.  Another
than the torches immediately surrounding the gate, there is little other
light making the gate seem like a lit island in a sea of darkness.  Beyond
the gate, sitting perched on a stool, is the Warden of the Prisons, he seems
rather bored but yet manages to maintain a vigilant eye on the corridor of
the prisons, the noise of him moving up and down the corridor with the slow
klinking of his ring of keys seems to be the only noise coming from this
area.  Back to the north the gloom leads back to the stone stairwell which
leads back up into the light.

Beginning of the cells ~
Past the gate running the length of the cells to the south is this dim
musty passageway.  The Jailor sits here, almost asleep on his stool, doing a
grand job of making sure the prisoners are not doing anything you shouldnt
be.  The air here is not very musty, fresh air from the stairwells must keep
the air here fresh, well fresher than the air at the end of the passageway. 
The passageway leads south, passing the doors and gates of many of the cells
that inhabit this area, the passage way is dotted with light, this light
comes from the few torches that are bracketed to the walls of the area.

Before two large secure cells~
The passage continues here, here before two of the larger cells in the
prison area it is lighter than else where.  Two torches sit on the walls
near the steel gate leading into the two cells.  Both cells are almost
identical in size and appearance, both have large steel bars making up for
walls and allowing the jailor to see what his prisoners are up to.  Inside
each cell there is a pair of crudely constructed bunkbeds and a large hole
acting as a lavatory.  The passageway leads further into the cells, going
south and near by to the north is the entrance to the cell area, marked by a
large steel gate by which the Jailor sits sleepily on his stool.

On a damp, dark passage~
Still continuing the passageway seems to dim slightly as it moves away
from the light cast off by the torches near the entrance to each cell.  The
air on the passageway is damp and humid, the cells are deep underground,
probally the cause of the dampness.  Not only is the air damp but its musty,
no fresh air has been through here in quite some time obviously.  The
passageway leads south to another large cell and leads off ending in what
looks to be a single steel door.  Back to the north sits the entrance to
cells a large steel gate guarded half-heartedly by a sleepy jailor.  The
walls of the passageway are rough as if cut out of the rock itself, that
would be one time consuming and hard job.

Nearing the end of the dark passage~
The passageway never gets any lighter, it runs here still, nearing a door
to the south.  The torches that are randomly placed in the passageway dont
give off enough light to illuminate the cell area properly, they barely give
of enough light to make out the doors and cells that make up the prisons. 
The passageway continues both north and south, leading both deeper into the
cells and out of them.  A musty smell seems to plague the area, not
suprising considering the jail area's construction.  To the north the jailor
sits, silently on his stool almost asleep ignoring the noise emitted from
the cells.

The end of the narrow dim passage~
The dimly, underlit passageway ends in three doors in all cardinal
directions save north, the direction in which the passage retreats.  The
door to the south differs from the other two in that there is not window
slot in it, how does the captive get food?  The doors to the east and west
are identical, entrances obviously into two standard cells unlike that one
to the south.  The only person along the hallway that isnt locked in a cell
is the jailor, who sits back to the north drifting off to sleep on his
stool.  The few torches dotting the passageway pick up the metal that makes
out the larger of the two cells back to the north, those cells are more open
than the rest and usually hold more people.  A musty smell seems to plague
the area, not suprising considering the jail area's construction.

A damp cell~
The darkness envelops the contents of the cell, the only light that
penetrates into this dark and gloomy area does so through the small grate in
the wooden door which bars entry and exit from the cells.  The layout of the
room was not made with the comfort of the prisoners in mind, the single
wooden bench at the back of the room is tilted at a slight angle towards the
ground making sleeping on it all but impossible.  The smell of decay in this
room is almost unbearable; it's a horrid mixture of fetid and rotting
clothing mixed in with the smell of unwashed humans.  The walls of the cell
show definite signs of age and seem to be covered in a slimy rotted
substance.

An isolated dark cell~
The sound of water dripping continously onto the cold stone floor breaks
the intense silence that falls over this room.  The smell decay lolls around
the room never dispaiting due to the fact that the room is sealed up tight,
it isnt called an isolation cell for nothing.  The little light there is
that penetrates into this room makes next to no difference, the cell is
still dark as the night.  What can be made out in the dark is not much, the
cell is small and very cramped built to discomfort its occupants, the only
way into and out of the cell is the reinforced and locked door that can be
made out to the north

A larger cell~
In this dark, damp and cold room many prisoners are held.  The cell is
mainly used for keeping groups of prisoners who pose no threat being with
others, there are other cells, more isolated cells for those who need the
'special treatment'.  One of the walls of the cell is made up of a large
iron grating; it lets some light into the otherwise dark cell, the light
coming from the torches kept near the entrance to the prisons for the
Wardens usage.  In the cell itself the walls are lined with uncomfortable
wooden benches provided to give prisoners at least some comfort.  Other the
rustling noises of chains coming from within the prisons, the only other
noise is the slow and steady tap of the Warden as he patrols the corridors
make sure everything is in order.  A small fetid smell seems to linger in
the air of the prison, smell built up from the rotten food fed to the
prisoners as well as the awful and old clothing they don.  The gate to the
east leads back into the corridor of the prisons.

A damp but large cell~
In this dark, damp and cold room many prisoners are held.  The cell is
mainly used for keeping groups of prisoners who pose no threat being with
others, there are other cells, more isolated cells for those who need the
'special treatment'.  One of the walls of the cell is made up of a large

A stable in the inner courtyard~
Into the stable the smell of manure and old hay is over bearing.  The
smell seems to come from the two stalls located to the south and west.  The
stalls have specially made hinged doors attached to them, the doors are
special because they dont block the entire doorway only half of it.  Behind
the stall doors horses can be seen from the looks of it, each stall can hold
about three horses depending on both the size of the horse and the size of
the stall.  The stables continue to the east leading further into the
building.

A stall in one of the inner courtyard's stables~
This stall is rather well kept obviously it is the personal stall of one
of the high ranking officers in the Fortress of the Light.  The stall is not
very large, big enough for one horse maybe two at a push but even though it
is not large it is rather clean and fresh.  A large pile of fresh hay sits
in the corner of the room providing a warm bed for the horse that occupies
the room, as well as the hay there is a water trough next to it filled with
refreshingly cool water.

Passing the stalls of the stable~
The stable continues here passing another stall to the east.  The smell
seems to increase as on moves further into the stable, passing more of the
stalls where the smell seems to come from.  The stall to the east is rather
pungent, and of medium size.  Through the stall's door three horses can be
seen, the horses are all different colors and from the looks of it they have
more than enough space to stay comfortable in the stall.  The stables
continue to the south.

A rather foul stall~
This stall is of a rather large size and it has two doors leading out of
it, one to the west and the other to the south.  The smell here is almost
unbearable, the hay lying here is rather old and gives of a horrible stench
which is not helped by the presence of another smell that of manure. 
Obviously the horses in the stall feel no discomfort being used to this
smell having being subjected to it over may years.

A larger stall~
The air here is surprisingly pleasant, obviously locating this stable
near to the north entrance to the stable was a good idea as the cool breeze
carries the foul smell away and out of the stable, if only all the other
stalls could be situated just as well.  This stall is home to many horses
mainly due to its large proportions, the horses that reside here in have
plenty of space to be comfortable.  There is a large trough full of hay
sitting against the western wall not surprising it is a favourite place for
the horses to conjugate.  There are two stall doors leading into and out of
this stall, one to the east the other to the north.

Through the stable~
The way continues through the stable, leading ultimtely to one of the two
exits and entrances to and from the stable.  One is situated on the eastern
side of the stable, the other is on the northern side located just below the
Gallows.  Two doors sit here, one to the south and one to the west.  The one
to the west leads into a large stall a stall which has two doors leading
into it, the other can be seen clearly here and is leads north out of the
stall.  The door is the south is a full size oak door, not the hall doors
like on the stalls, and obviously it leads into the stable master's office
where all transactions to do with the mounts kept in this stable take place.
The smell of stale hay and manure lingers in the air here making it well
known that this building is used as a stable.

Another way into the inner courtyard~
The path through the stable heads towards its eastern exit here, passing
two stalls.  The stall to the south goes back quite a bit, it is probally
two stalls linked together, as it is so deep it can hold lots of horses. 
The stall door to the south is a little larger and wider than the others in
the stable this is most probally a common stall used to house many horses
while the others may be private ones, reserved for officers and lords.  The
stall to the north has two doors leading into it, the other is on its
western side.  The path exits the stables to the east.

The stable master's office~
This office is rather small and cramped, obviously the stable master that
resides here is of little importance even though the Children are always
deployed as mounted units.  Perhaps there is another stable in the Fortress
a main one which is more important than this one.  Although small, this
office is not lacking in furniture, there is a large wooden desk that takes
up the majority of the space in the room, behind which there is a large and
heavy wooden chair.  To go with both the desk and the chair there is wooden
cabinet sitting in the corner of the room.  Behind the desk sits the Stable
Master who calmly goes through various pieces of paper.  The only exit is
the door to the north.

A linked stall~
This stall is rather large and deep, it stretches back for quite a bit. 
The stall is simply constructed using stone reinforced by wooden beams for
stability.  This stall is a typical one, a bundle of hay occupying the
corner of the room for the comfort of the horses residing in the stall. 
That odor lingers strongly in this room a mix of manure and hay.  The stall
door to the north leads back into the stables.

The end of the stall~
This stall is both wide and long, making it large enough for quite a few
horses.  There is an unmistakable smell lingering here, that of horse's
manure and mixed in with that to make it even more unplesant is the smell of
stale hay.  The door leading into this stable lies back to the north, in the
other half of this stall.

A stone corridor nearing a staircase~
These corridors and hallways run through this floor leading to the
various classes, lecture rooms and even the grand library that is situated
here.  The hall of Inquisition is also located on this floor, on the eastern
side where it is guarded to prevent non-members of the Hand from entering. 
The corridor is rather plane with small decorations to improve the otherwise
dull white stonewalls.  There are two staircases located on this floor, both
accessible by the various corridors.  Many Children frequent this floor,
heading towards their various destinations be it a class, lecture, a visit
to the library or even a route to the upper levels.  This stone corridor
continues north and south, north towards a staircase and south, leading into
the fourth floor.

A staircase on the third floor leading upwards and downwards~
The staircase here leads upwards to the fourth floor of the Fortress. 
The staircase itself is rather simple in design, it allows access for a
large number of people at the same time, such is required due to the large
number of people who need to reach the top floors of the Fortress.  The
walls of the staircase here are made of the same material as the hallway
which passes by the staircase to the south; smooth and rather plain white
stone.  There are few decorations around the staircase although a
brilliantly entwined runner of yellow and white silk curls its way up the
hand railings of the staircase like some sort of Amadacian serpent only
existing in myth.  The corridor to the south leads out, into the Third floor
of the Fortress of the light.

The Dome of Truth~
The simple site of the Dome of Truth in all its glory is breathtaking
enough let alone the visage of the rest of the extremely great and beautiful
chamber.  The whole chamber is bathed in gold leaf thrown down from the
thousands of golden lamps hanging more than fifty paces from the pure white
marble floor.  The golden dome stretches unsupported for over one hundred
paces and rises another fifty paces towering high above the chamber daunting
it with its almighty presence.  Around the edge of the Golden dome,
supporting it are a row of plain white marble columns each one an equal
distance apart from the other making up a circle around the dome and its
pure white dais.  Outside the inner chain of white columns runs another
circle of columns, equally plain and white and just as tall as before, this
row of columns runs near the walls of the chamber, each one in front of one
of the fifteen tall alcoves that were built out of the wall of the chamber. 
Each alcove is home to a different tapestry depicting the past of the
Children of the Light, making them the perfect place for secret meetings. 
The actually chamber of the Dome of Truth is very expansive, and in the dead
center, beneath the heart of the Dome sits a simple white marble dais, on
which stands the Lord Captain Commander of the Children of the Light to
address the assembled Children of the Light in their most solemn moments,
their most serious ceremonies, their darkest hour.  Wandering through the
chamber stunned by its sight are various children of the light, though they
rank from a simple Child to the Lord Captain Commander himself one think is
unchanged about them all, not a single one of them wields or for that matter
even carries a weapon of any not even a belt knife.  All weapons are left at
the entrance to the dome in the weapons rack provided.  To the south, hidden
from view by a pillar of marble is an alcove.

A Corner of the Dome of Truth~
The simple site of the Dome of Truth in all its glory is breathtaking
enough let alone the visage of the rest of the extremely great and beautiful
chamber.  The whole chamber is bathed in gold leaf thrown down from the
thousands of golden lamps hanging more than fifty paces from the pure white
marble floor.  The golden dome stretches unsupported for over one hundred
paces and rises another fifty paces towering high above the chamber daunting
it with its almighty presence.  Around the edge of the Golden dome,
supporting it are a row of plain white marble columns each one an equal
distance apart from the other making up a circle around the dome and its
pure white dais.  Outside the inner chain of white columns runs another
circle of columns, equally plain and white and just as tall as before, this
row of columns runs near the walls of the chamber, each one in front of one
of the fifteen tall alcoves that were built out of the wall of the chamber. 
Each alcove is home to a different tapestry depicting the past of the
Children of the Light, making them the perfect place for secret meetings. 
The actually chamber of the Dome of Truth is very expansive, and in the dead
center, beneath the heart of the Dome sits a simple white marble dais, on
which stands the Lord Captain Commander of the Children of the Light to
address the assembled Children of the Light in their most solemn moments,
their most serious ceremonies, their darkest hour.  Wandering through the
chamber stunned by its sight are various children of the light, though they
rank from a simple Child to the Lord Captain Commander himself one think is
unchanged about them all, not a single one of them wields or for that matter
even carries a weapon of any not even a belt knife.  All weapons are left at
the entrance to the dome in the weapons rack provided.  A white marble
pillar that stretches to the roof, half hides the alcoves to the east and
south.

A hidden alcove~
This small yet rather tall alcove is hidden from the rest of the chamber
in the Dome of Truth by a simple white marble column that rises the full
length from marble floor to roof.  The alcove is wide enough to fit quite a
large amount of people, stretching almost two spans across and eight spans
up almost to the pure white ceiling.  As it is well hidden from the rest of
the chambers, the alcove makes the perfect meeting spot for members of the
Hand of the Light that frequent the chamber, basking in the true beauty of
the Dome of Truth.  A gold leaf shadow half bathes this alcove, coming
directly from the thousands of lamps that hang near the roof of the Dome
itself, reflecting its gold surface, shining down rays of golden light which
makes the entire chamber look even more spectacular.  This alcove like all
the other is dominated by a large tapestry depicting a scene from the
history of the Children of the Light, whether it be a battle won for the
Light or a Darkfriend hung for betraying the light.

pure white dais.  Outside the inner chain of white columns runs another
circle of columns, equally plain and white and just as tall as before, this
row of columns runs near the walls of the chamber, each one in front of one
of the fifteen tall alcoves that were built out of the wall of the chamber. 
Each alcove is home to a different tapestry depicting the past of the
Children of the Light, making them the perfect place for secret meetings. 
The actually chamber of the Dome of Truth is very expansive, and in the dead
center, beneath the heart of the Dome sits a simple white marble dais, on
which stands the Lord Captain Commander of the Children of the Light to
address the assembled Children of the Light in their most solemn moments,
their most serious ceremonies, their darkest hour.  Wandering through the
chamber stunned by its sight are various children of the light, though they
rank from a simple Child to the Lord Captain Commander himself one think is
unchanged about them all, not a single one of them wields or for that matter
even carries a weapon of any not even a belt knife.  All weapons are left at
the entrance to the dome in the weapons rack provided.  Near by, to the east
hidden behind one of the plain white marble pillars is a tall alcove.

A hidden alcove~
This small yet rather tall alcove is hidden from the rest of the chamber
in the Dome of Truth by a simple white marble column that rises the full
length from marble floor to roof.  The alcove is wide enough to fit quite a
large amount of people, stretching almost two spans across and eight spans
up almost to the pure white ceiling.  As it is well hidden from the rest of
the chambers, the alcove makes the perfect meeting spot for members of the
Hand of the Light that frequent the chamber, basking in the true beauty of
the Dome of Truth.  A gold leaf shadow half bathes this alcove, coming
directly from the thousands of lamps that hang near the roof of the Dome
itself, reflecting its gold surface, shining down rays of golden light which
makes the entire chamber look even more spectacular.  This alcove like all
the other is dominated by a large tapestry depicting a scene from the
history of the Children of the Light, whether it be a battle won for the
Light or a Darkfriend hung for betraying the light.

The Dome of Truth~
The simple site of the Dome of Truth in all its glory is breathtaking
enough let alone the visage of the rest of the extremely great and beautiful
chamber.  The whole chamber is bathed in gold leaf thrown down from the
thousands of golden lamps hanging more than fifty paces from the pure white
marble floor.  The golden dome stretches unsupported for over one hundred
paces and rises another fifty paces towering high above the chamber daunting
it with its almighty presence.  Around the edge of the Golden dome,
supporting it are a row of plain white marble columns each one an equal
distance apart from the other making up a circle around the dome and its
pure white dais.  Outside the inner chain of white columns runs another
circle of columns, equally plain and white and just as tall as before, this

The Dome of Truth~
The simple site of the Dome of Truth in all its glory is breathtaking
enough let alone the visage of the rest of the extremely great and beautiful
chamber.  The whole chamber is bathed in gold leaf thrown down from the
thousands of golden lamps hanging more than fifty paces from the pure white
marble floor.  The golden dome stretches unsupported for over one hundred
paces and rises another fifty paces towering high above the chamber daunting
it with its almighty presence.  Around the edge of the Golden dome,
supporting it are a row of plain white marble columns each one an equal
distance apart from the other making up a circle around the dome and its
pure white dais.  Outside the inner chain of white columns runs another
circle of columns, equally plain and white and just as tall as before, this
row of columns runs near the walls of the chamber, each one in front of one
of the fifteen tall alcoves that were built out of the wall of the chamber. 
Each alcove is home to a different tapestry depicting the past of the
Children of the Light, making them the perfect place for secret meetings. 
The actually chamber of the Dome of Truth is very expansive, and in the dead
center, beneath the heart of the Dome sits a simple white marble dais, on
which stands the Lord Captain Commander of the Children of the Light to
address the assembled Children of the Light in their most solemn moments,
their most serious ceremonies, their darkest hour.  Wandering through the
chamber stunned by its sight are various children of the light, though they
rank from a simple Child to the Lord Captain Commander himself one think is
unchanged about them all, not a single one of them wields or for that matter
even carries a weapon of any not even a belt knife.  All weapons are left at
the entrance to the dome in the weapons rack provided.

A hidden alcove~
This small yet rather tall alcove is hidden from the rest of the chamber
in the Dome of Truth by a simple white marble column that rises the full
length from marble floor to roof.  The alcove is wide enough to fit quite a
large amount of people, stretching almost two spans across and eight spans
up almost to the pure white ceiling.  As it is well hidden from the rest of
the chambers, the alcove makes the perfect meeting spot for members of the
Hand of the Light that frequent the chamber, basking in the true beauty of
the Dome of Truth.  A gold leaf shadow half bathes this alcove, coming
directly from the thousands of lamps that hang near the roof of the Dome
itself, reflecting its gold surface, shining down rays of golden light which
makes the entire chamber look even more spectacular.  This alcove like all
the other is dominated by a large tapestry depicting a scene from the
history of the Children of the Light, whether it be a battle won for the
Light or a Darkfriend hung for betraying the light.

The simple site of the Dome of Truth in all its glory is breathtaking
enough let alone the visage of the rest of the extremely great and beautiful
chamber.  The whole chamber is bathed in gold leaf thrown down from the
thousands of golden lamps hanging more than fifty paces from the pure white
marble floor.  The golden dome stretches unsupported for over one hundred
paces and rises another fifty paces towering high above the chamber daunting
it with its almighty presence.  Around the edge of the Golden dome,
supporting it are a row of plain white marble columns each one an equal
distance apart from the other making up a circle around the dome and its
pure white dais.  Outside the inner chain of white columns runs another
circle of columns, equally plain and white and just as tall as before, this
row of columns runs near the walls of the chamber, each one in front of one
of the fifteen tall alcoves that were built out of the wall of the chamber. 
Each alcove is home to a different tapestry depicting the past of the
Children of the Light, making them the perfect place for secret meetings. 
The actually chamber of the Dome of Truth is very expansive, and in the dead
center, beneath the heart of the Dome sits a simple white marble dais, on
which stands the Lord Captain Commander of the Children of the Light to
address the assembled Children of the Light in their most solemn moments,
their most serious ceremonies, their darkest hour.  Wandering through the
chamber stunned by its sight are various children of the light, though they
rank from a simple Child to the Lord Captain Commander himself one think is
unchanged about them all, not a single one of them wields or for that matter
even carries a weapon of any not even a belt knife.  All weapons are left at
the entrance to the dome in the weapons rack provided.

A hidden alcove~
This small yet rather tall alcove is hidden from the rest of the chamber
in the Dome of Truth by a simple white marble column that rises the full
length from marble floor to roof.  The alcove is wide enough to fit quite a
large amount of people, stretching almost two spans across and eight spans
up almost to the pure white ceiling.  As it is well hidden from the rest of
the chambers, the alcove makes the perfect meeting spot for members of the
Hand of the Light that frequent the chamber, basking in the true beauty of
the Dome of Truth.  A gold leaf shadow half bathes this alcove, coming
directly from the thousands of lamps that hang near the roof of the Dome
itself, reflecting its gold surface, shining down rays of golden light which
makes the entire chamber look even more spectacular.  This alcove like all
the other is dominated by a large tapestry depicting a scene from the
history of the Children of the Light, whether it be a battle won for the
Light or a Darkfriend hung for betraying the light.

The Dome of Truth~
The simple site of the Dome of Truth in all its glory is breathtaking
enough let alone the visage of the rest of the extremely great and beautiful
chamber.  The whole chamber is bathed in gold leaf thrown down from the
thousands of golden lamps hanging more than fifty paces from the pure white
marble floor.  The golden dome stretches unsupported for over one hundred
paces and rises another fifty paces towering high above the chamber daunting
it with its almighty presence.  Around the edge of the Golden dome,
supporting it are a row of plain white marble columns each one an equal
distance apart from the other making up a circle around the dome and its
pure white dais.  Outside the inner chain of white columns runs another
circle of columns, equally plain and white and just as tall as before, this
row of columns runs near the walls of the chamber, each one in front of one
of the fifteen tall alcoves that were built out of the wall of the chamber. 
Each alcove is home to a different tapestry depicting the past of the
Children of the Light, making them the perfect place for secret meetings. 
The actually chamber of the Dome of Truth is very expansive, and in the dead
center, beneath the heart of the Dome sits a simple white marble dais, on
which stands the Lord Captain Commander of the Children of the Light to
address the assembled Children of the Light in their most solemn moments,
their most serious ceremonies, their darkest hour.  Wandering through the
chamber stunned by its sight are various children of the light, though they
rank from a simple Child to the Lord Captain Commander himself one think is
unchanged about them all, not a single one of them wields or for that matter
even carries a weapon of any not even a belt knife.  All weapons are left at
the entrance to the dome in the weapons rack provided.  To the north lies a
hidden alcove.

A hidden alcove~
This small yet rather tall alcove is hidden from the rest of the chamber
in the Dome of Truth by a simple white marble column that rises the full
length from marble floor to roof.  The alcove is wide enough to fit quite a
large amount of people, stretching almost two spans across and eight spans
up almost to the pure white ceiling.  As it is well hidden from the rest of
the chambers, the alcove makes the perfect meeting spot for members of the
Hand of the Light that frequent the chamber, basking in the true beauty of
the Dome of Truth.  A gold leaf shadow half bathes this alcove, coming
directly from the thousands of lamps that hang near the roof of the Dome
itself, reflecting its gold surface, shining down rays of golden light which
makes the entire chamber look even more spectacular.  This alcove like all
the other is dominated by a large tapestry depicting a scene from the
history of the Children of the Light, whether it be a battle won for the
Light or a Darkfriend hung for betraying the light.

The top floor of the Fortress~
This well lit hallway is the linking corridor between the offices of the
Lord Captain command and the High Inquisitor and the glorious dome of truth,
located to the south.  At regular intervals along the hallway, wall
decorations have been mounted to live up the otherwise drab stonewalls. 
Natural light can beam in through the stained glass windows that are set
high up, above in the hallway they are the main source of light.  At night,
the wall-mounted lanterns throw down enough light to brighten up the
corridor.  The lanterns light dances off of the windows and throws down
dancing rays of light that move as gracefully as a battle-hardened warder. 
A beautifully crafted staircase is also situated off this hallway, a
staircase which sees frequent use as it is the only staircase leading up to
this floor.  The staircase leads down to the floors below.  The hallway here
is usually busy with Children of the Light bustling along to stare in awe
and the glorious sight of the heart of the Children of the Light, the Dome
of Truth.  Just here, the staircase leads off downwards while the dome lies
to the south.

The corridor merges leading west and east~
This hallway although not very long has great importance, mainly due to
the fact that it is the only corridor that links the High Inquisitor's
office and the Lord Captain Commander's Office with the rest of the
Fortress.  Surprisingly the hallway is not as heavily guarded as one would
expect, with only two guards standing at attention before the junction into
this corridor, one a member of the Lord Captain Commander's honor guard, the
other that of the High Inquisitor, both trained to protect their leaders
with their lives if the case demands it.  To the north sits a closed pair of
doors, leading into a main meeting room that is coincidently exactly halfway
between the two offices on this level.  On the floor here, made up as part
of the floor is a perfectly made mosaic of the Blazing sunburst of the
light, it shines from the amount of attention it gets by the many people
that walk these hallways.  To the east, not too far away lies a heavily
decorated oaken door above which hands a tapestry of the hand of the light's
calling sign, the Shepard's crook.  To the west lies another door just as
heavily decorated as before leading into the Lord Captain Commander's
offices.  Back to the south lies the stairwell down to the rest of the
fortress.

Inquisitor of the Light.  Along this hallway are many runners of red silk
crossing black and the odd tapestry depicting various Children related
scenes.  Far to the west lies another door just as heavily decorated as
before leading into the Lord Captain Commander's offices.  To the west and a
little south lies the stairwell down to the rest of the fortress.

In the glory of the light~
Before the very door that leads into the High Inquisitor's chambers the
air seems relaxing and calm above the door is a expertly crafter tapestry of
the Shepard's crook of the Hand of the Light, perfectly framing the door
behind which its leader resides.  Another door sits to the north, a marking
on the door indicates it to be the High Inquisitor's very own hand picked
honor guard staying close to him at all times.  This hallway although not
very long has great importance, mainly due to the fact that it is the only
corridor that links the High Inquisitor's office and the Lord Captain
Commander's Office with the rest of the Fortress.  Surprisingly the hallway
is not as heavily guarded as one would expect, with only two guards standing
at attention before the junction into this corridor, one a member of the
Lord Captain Commander's honor guard, the other that of the High Inquisitor,
both trained to protect their leaders with their lives if the case demands
it.  Far to the west lies another door just as heavily decorated as before
leading into the Lord Captain Commander's offices.  To the west and a little
south lies the stairwell down to the rest of the fortress.

A handful of guards, the High Inquisitor's elite~
This room is more of a barracks than a simple room.  Its not very
extensive but is sufficient to house the High Inquisitor's personal Honor
Guard of fifteen men.  Along the walls of the room lie numerous double
decker bunkbeds made of oak, strong and sturdy enough to bed the occupants
of this room.  A desk complete with chair sit against the far wall and along
the near wall is a weapons rack stacked full of weaponry and various tools
for cleaning and sharpening weapons.  At the foot of each bunkbed is a large
wooden chest in which obviously the guard's personal belongings are kept
neatly, everything he needs ranging from washing utensils to combat armor. 
There are no other doors in the room save the one leading back south into
the corridor before the High Inquisitor's office.

The foyer of the High Inquisitor's rooms~
This is a rather spacious room and its contents take up next to no space
at all.  It is also very well decorated, emblems and tapestries brighten up
the room and a mosaic of the Shepard's crook of the Hand lies on the ground
surrounding by pale marble with bluish veins.  Along the near wall are two
luxurious soft wood benches, the surface of which are made up by dark red
cushion, bordered with black tassel providing a comfortable spot for
visitors to sit while they wait.  A large desk made up of two large and dark
pieces of oak forming an L I the corner of the room, behind the desk and the
papers covering the desk sits a rather young looking man, obviously the High
Inquisitor's secretary.  Four large and heavy doors lead in the four
cardinal directions; north, south, west, east.  The door to the east leads
into the High Inquisitor's study and quarters, the door to the north leads
to the Meeting room of the hand, the door to the south leads into a small
decorated hallway leading into the High Inquisitor's throne room overlooking
the fortress and the door to the west leads back into the top floor of the
Fortress.

The High Inquisitor's study ~
This elaborate office takes up a very large space, not unusual for the
High Inquisitor of the Light who lives for grandeur.  The room consists of
his study, personal library, and window over looking the fortress.  His
study where he receives, rights and destroys various reports from his agents
in the field and his Officers in the hand is vast and does not consist
solely of his heavily carved desk but also a wooden cabinet for filing
perhaps and a array of chairs for those visiting his office.  Making up most
of the room are the shelves of his personal library, apparently these
shelves hold vast unique knowledge on all subjects bar one, Aes Sedai... 
The air is slightly heavy a nd musky probably the bad side of having so many
old books in his library.  On the whole the room seems to portray the right
image for that of a High Inquisitor, spotless, neat and most of all
imposing.  Behind the desk is a tapestry depicting the banner of the hand
flowing in a strong breeze and in the foreground slowly lolling in circles
hangs a corpse, a corpse of an Aes Sedai.  The room expands to the east and
south while the door back to the secretarys room lies to the west.

A large meeting room~
This small aging room is brightly lit by a roaring fire, which lies on
the far end of the room in an ornate heath.  Besides the fire, there is a
rather large, long and heavy oak table that stretches the length of the room
taking up all but some of the space of the room.  Around the table hanging
from the low rafters are various banners of many nations and houses, there
significance is unknown, maybe banners carried into war or even banners
captured in war.  The table is inscribed with various intricate patterns
crisscrossing the table face making the room look even grander.  At various
intervals along the table sit heavy oak chairs, each inscribed with some
sort of herald on the back and each consisting of a plush purple cushion.

A short, small hallway leading into a meeting room~
This little corridor leads into the meeting room of the Hand, although
short this corridor is far from dull and boring.  Running alongside the
hallway is a runner of red and white silk entwined running right up to the
door and up over it meeting in the middle with the runner from the other
side of the hallway.  As well as the runner there is a rather large
wall-hanging depicting two banners flying over the Fortress the Sunburst of
the Children and the Shepard's Crook of the Hand.  The door at the end of
the hallway is made of a thick wood and is closed maybe even locked.

In the glory of the Hand~
This room must be a meeting place for the Hand of the Light's higher
officers, as it is extremely aristocratic and elaborate.  The walls are far
from bare, each one draped with silk and banners of different organizations
and countries, the biggest one being the triangular Banner of the Shepard's
crook denoting the Hand that lies behind the throne.  The throne itself is
another wonder of the room, it sits on a raised dais at the back of the room
and the throne itself is quite something.  Its made out of a very intense
and soft wood, and has been fashioned and carved to make it.  The arms are
carved crooks the symbol of the Hand.  Behind the throne and to the left is
a rather large window that looks out to the courtyard below, the main
courtyard of the Fortress of the Light.

looking extremely comfortable and inviting while a desk, smaller th an that
in the High Inquisitor's study but still rather big and like that in the
study piled high with papers and parchments sits against the near wall.  As
well as these pieces of furniture, near the bed there are some chests of
drawers and a rather large mannequin on which resides a suit of beautifully
crafted plate mail, gleaming gold crossed with silver and the occasional
jewel of some sort, definitely the sort of item only a man of such stature

A staircase leading up to the top floor of the fortress~
At the end of the stone hallway, is this large elaborate staircase that
leads simply upwards, to the top floor of the Fortress where only Children
dare go, others not wanting to run into any of the high ranking Children
that frequent the floor.  Even though many people make use of the staircase,
going up to see the fames sight of the Dome of Truth, its pure white marble
surface is unmarked or scarred in any way, it sparkles slightly in the
light.  The corridor that runs to the staircase leads back to the north will
the staircase casually makes its way upwards to the top floor of the
Fortress.

Along a short corridor~
This corridor is, to a certain extent, short.  It only leads from the
main corridor of this floor to a large staircase, which lies just to the
south.  As with the main corridor of the floor the walls of this hallway are
made of white stone, which is cold to the touch not to mention smooth.  Size
does not seem to matter for this corridor as the number of people that
frequent it is much greater than the main corridor here, probably due to the
fact that the staircase to the north leads up to the top floor where the
Lord Captain Commander's office and the Dome of Truth reside.  To the north
the corridor returns to the main hallway.

Here, off the main stone corridor breaks a smaller one leading not very
far to the south and ending in a rather large staircase, which seems to be
frequently in use.  The main corridor continues, running west and north
making a neat junction of the corridor here.  The corridor is well designed,
its neat stonewalls are smooth and without flaw and at various parts of the
corridor the walls are home to large wall hanging or tapestries.  As well as
the tapestries various other decorations are in place to brighten up the
hallways, there are golden candle holders, runners of silk, intricately
carved doors and shields bearing the herald of the Children of the Light, a
blazing sunburst.  To the south breaks a small corridor while the main one
continues to the west and to the north.

side where it is guarded to prevent non-members of the Hand from entering. 
The corridor is rather plane with small decorations to improve the otherwise
dull white stonewalls.  There are two staircases located on this floor, both
accessible by the various corridors.  Many Children frequent this floor,
heading towards their various destinations be it a class, lecture, a visit
to the library or even a route to the upper levels.  Here, the corridor
leads west and east, westwards leads towards the many classes and other
rooms on this floor while east leads back to the intersection and to the

A small auditorium~
The seats laid out for those attending speeches or lectures in this
auditorium form large and long rows of small backed, beige colored chairs. 
The rows of chairs gradually incline backwards, their peak being at the very
back of the auditorium.  From anywhere in the seats, the speaker can be
heard clearly and accurately, this is mainly due to the padded walls, which
absorb echoes and the lay out of the seating.  The stage can also be seen
clearly from almost anywhere in the auditorium, as the slanting chairs mean
that no ones view is blocked by a person sitting in front of them.  Clearly
seen on the stage is a large podium for the speaker, various chairs for
sitting and a small table for resting things on.  At the back of the
auditorium's stage hanging from the roof is a large pennant bearing the
blazing sunburst of the Children of the Light.

of this extremely large room.  The stage is made of shiny paneled wood and
in the center of this stage is a large podium and next to the podium is a
table put in place for the speaker's books and belongings.  As well as the
table and podium, there are a few seats on the stage put in place if the
speaker or the speaker's helpers need them.  The surrounding chairs of the
auditorium are all in neat rows and each row is at a different height than
its predecessor making a sloped incline leading backwards.  The room is well
constructed as well, with padded walls to absorb the echo of a speaker's
voice and the rows of inclined seating are positioned so that the speaker's
words can be heard from anywhere inside the auditorium.  At the back of the
stage hanging from the roof is a large pennant bearing the blazing sunburst
of the Children of the Light.

south, west and east with the exit back to the north.  Here in this room
sits a large L shaped desk behind which a rather old and overworked lady
sits working through paper after paper of reports and checking outs of
books.  The library is rather elaborate; its high ceiling is home to many
arches crossing each other forming Xs, hanging from the ceiling at various
points are brass chandeliers hanging just above the level of the shelf upon
shelf of books.  This must be the main library of the Fortress for so detail
to be put into it, in the center of the library on the floor is a mosaic of
the sunburst of the light, various other references to the light can be
seen, the stain-glass windows to the south are mixed with bright colors,
bright yellows, oranges and whites, even the general picture of the stain-
glass window has a sunburst in it.  The library is well divided into
sections for the different books, having a home for almost every subject
that may be required, arts, literature, warfare, history, culture, etc.  As
well as the bookcases and desk at the entrance to the library there are
various tables with chairs set out for those wishing to read or gather
information in the library.

its guardian, the librarian.  The library is rather elaborate; its high
ceiling is home to many arches crossing each other forming Xs, hanging from
the ceiling at various points are brass chandeliers hanging just above the
level of the shelf upon shelf of books.  This must be the main library of
the Fortress for so detail to be put into it, in the center of the library
on the floor is a mosaic of the sunburst of the light, various other
references to the light can be seen, the stain-glass windows to the south
are mixed with bright colors, bright yellows, oranges and whites, even the
general picture of the stain-glass window has a sunburst in it.  The library
is well divided into sections for the different books, having a home for
almost every subject that may be required, arts, literature, warfare,
history, culture, etc.  As well as the bookcases and desk at the entrance to
the library there are various tables with chairs set out for those wishing
to read or gather information in the library.

The Main gate of the Inner courtyard~
The fabled Inner Courtyard gate, known as the Gate of Light is rather
wide, wide enough to allow two wagons passage through it simultaneously as
well as allowing the guards to stand at attention in their positions at the
sides of the gates.  There are numerous guards posted here at the gate, all
dressed in the typical attire of the Children of the Light and all armed and
warily watching those that pass by.  The gatehouse above is home to both the
iron portcullis that can be lowered to secure the gate, as well as numerous
murder holes in place for the defense of the Inner-courtyard.  The gatehouse
does not really serve as keep so to speak it mainly serves as the last line
of defense for the Fortress, should the heavily guarded Outer-gate be
penetrated.  The main gate in the outer-courtyard acts as the keep for the
Fortress, it being home to a large majority of the guards.  The actually
stonework of the gate is quite spectacular, each stone has been carefully
smoothed and secured tightly, the walls are mainly un-blemished save for the
odd dirt stain.

A rather small classroom~
This classroom is not very big, it contains a small number of desks,
maybe fifteen or twenty.  As most classrooms, the room is strictly
organized, each desk is perfectly lined up with each other and an equal
distance apart.  At the front of the classroom is a larger desk, obviously
the desk used by the teacher of the class, and beside it is a partially
cleaned blackboard, with what looks to be a map drawn on it, half of it has
been rubbed away.  The desks are all made of oak wood, including the
teacher's desk, oak being cheap to use and rather light depending on the
density of the desks.  There is only one way into and out of this classroom
and that is a good distance away from the desks.  On the walls of the
classroom various pictures and maps hang, the biggest hanging is that of a
map of Amador including the Fortress of the Light.

A quiet study room~
This room set aside from studying is cut off from the hallway by a large
oak door, used to block noise coming from outside of the room.  The room is
silent, not a word is spoken, diligent Children of the Light read through
various books and parchments and even some teacher's scan the texts, looking
for information for their lessons.  The room is made up by a cluster of
chairs around tables also made from oak as the door, these tables are piled
up with books and manuscripts on various subjects, most of them have been
taken from the large library that is situated somewhere on this floor.  The
room has plain white stonewalls as the rest of the Fortress and a small bolt

Continuing north along a hallway~
These corridors and hallways run through this floor leading to the
various classes, lecture rooms and even the grand library that is situated
here.  The hall of Inquisition is also located on this floor, on the eastern
side where it is guarded to prevent non-members of the Hand from entering. 
The corridor is rather plane with small decorations to improve the otherwise
dull white stonewalls.  There are two staircases located on this floor, both
accessible by the various corridors.  Many Children frequent this floor,
heading towards their various destinations be it a class, lecture, a visit
to the library or even a route to the upper levels.  Another two doors line
the walls of the hall here.  To the west, the closed door leads into a store
room, used to store supplies necessary for the large number of classes in
the Fortress.  The door to the east leads into a small auditorium reserved
for small lectures or speeches.

This room holds all the supplies needed by this floor of the Fortress. 
Piled high are various bits of tapestry for writing, boxes containing
writing equipment such as quills, chalks for blackboards, cloths for erasing
blackboards, there is even a large blackboard sitting at the back of the
room, a spare just in case.  There are tapestry of ever size and shape in
piles also, and empty books not so big for those attending classes to take
notes and the like.  As well as stationery there are also other items, jars
of fuel for lanterns and unlit wicks as well as actually lanterns that can
be used to replace broken ones.  There are also some tools, a hammer, axe,
and even a box of nails for making repairs.

A small auditorium~
This auditorium is the second of its kind on this floor, it is not nearly
as big as the other one here but serves the same purpose, giving speeches to
people gathered that can hear and see everything clearly.  This is achieved
by the layout of the room, it also has padded walls to prevent or lessen the
effect of echoes from the speaker's speech, the chairs are on an inclined
plane giving each person a clear view of the speaker at his podium.  There
is no real stage in this auditorium, simply a podium situated at the bottom
of the rows of seats, there is not really a need for a stage, or the space
for one.  Behind the speaker's podium is a large hanging flag, this one the
same as the one in the larger auditorium, the Children of the Light's
sunburst.

of the Light which spawns the evil Hand of the Light and its Inquisitors. 
There is no real main hanging on the wall here but many each one depicting
something different, the strangest of them all though is a picture depicting
a scene somewhere in the Fortress why by a Child of the Light decked in the

A small restroom~
This room is extremely quiet, and many people lounge about in various
chairs in various states of sleep.  This is not exactly what you would call
a study room as but more of a rest room.  There is only one table and that
is mainly used as a pillow for beat soldiers of the Light, the chairs here
are all extremely comfortable and especially made for resting in as they are
being used.  The watch can be extremely tiring especially if something goes
wrong and those Children of the Light who do not have the rank enough to
return to the barracks or their quarters have to use rooms like this to
catch up on their sleep.  Although sleep is mainly the purpose of this room,
it can and is also used to study in, some people find rooms full of sleeping
people quieter than others with other people.

A classroom~
This class is definitely used for the teachings of Geography, as the
majority of the pictures and hangings on the wall are maps or artist
impressions of Amador, its surrounding area and the Fortress of the Light. 
The desks in this class are strange, instead of having many separate desks,
there are maybe seven or eight large ones each large desk has four chairs
around it and a large map in the center of the table, obviously the majority
of the work done here is done in groups of students.  The teacher's desk at
the head of the class is rather large and cluttered with rolled up maps,
documents and various other papers.  Towards the back of the class, behind
the arrangement of desks is a large three dimensional model of the Amadacia
region, it is quite spectacular in design and very well detailed.  The class
has only one entrance and exit and that is to the east.

This room is small and is adjoined to a room for discussing or lectures,
making it obviously difficult to study here given the noise.  But still, the
room has various tables and comfortable chairs for those wishing to brave it
and of course lectures are not always taking place.  The tables have a
selection of chairs around them and an equal number is at each table, the
tables are large and heavy made out of wood, probably oak and the chairs are
also made out of the same dark wood The air here is calm and peaceful an
extremely strange thing to find in the Children of the Light's home.  The
room is not very heavily decorated, bearing only plain white stone walls and
a large wall-hanging on the far wall of the great library of Cairhien.  To
the south is a small lecture room.

A lecture room~
This small room of the study hall to the north is not exactly a lecture
room so to speak.  It is basically a quiet room with a large number of
chairs all forming a semi-circle around one chair at the back of the room,
so it is more a discussion room than a lecture room.  The one person sitting
in the chair at the back usually leads the discussion with those using the
other seats taking part in it.  It need not even be a discussion for that
matter, idle chat among friends also takes place here or it can even be used
for catching up on the sleep lost during guard shift the night before.  The
room lacks decoration of any kind and the plain white stonewalls does not
help its appearance.  The study room is back to the north, and beyond that
is the firmly closed door, closed to keep the noise outside out, that leads
back into the halls.

obviously used for resting or reading lightly.  The air in the study room is

turned or a slight creak as people move about on their chairs, there is
great respect for others in this study room.  To the north is the closed

massive tomes of knowledge.

Tutor's main desk and, on the wall next to the main desk, is a large
blackboard, which at present is clear of writing.  The walls of the
classroom are not bare, far from it actually as the majority of the wall is
covered with tapestries and wall hanging depicting various scenes, most of
them related to History and the past of the Children of the Light.  The exit

are allowed here unless running errands or delivering messages.  The Hallway

Hall of Inquisition.  Only high-ranking members of the Children of the Light
are allowed here unless running errands or delivering messages.  The Hallway
is usually busy with many members of the Hand of the Light coming to attend
various lectures or to partake in a class or some kind.  The office of the
Lord Inquisitor is also located in this hallway, far to the south at the end
of the hallway.  The two doors that border this part of the hallway are
usually closed, the door to the west leads into one of the classrooms here,
while the door to the east leads into the massive auditorium.  The hallway
continues to the north and south.

to the east.  Although the room is small, it holds a large amount of
furniture, a large desk sits in the middle of the room directly in the
center between both doors obviously the desk for the reception of the office
behind the closed door to the east.  As well as the desk there are a few
comfortable looking chairs near the entrance to this room, used for those
awaiting a meeting with the owner of the office to the east and finally
there is a large wooden filling cabinet behind the desk used by the
receptionist for organizing various things for the office.  Most of the

An office~
This office is rather large and is home to the Lord Inquisitor of the
Hand of the Light, this Lord Inquisitor is responsible for all the
discipline in the training of the initiates to the Hand of the Light.  He
has to hand out punishments when required and even turn away those that are
not ready for the Hand.  In the office, a large wooden desk takes up the
majority of the space, there are also two comfortable looking chairs before
the desk and an even comfortable looking one behind the desk.  As well as
the desk and chairs there is an, extremely robust and extremely heavy,
cabinet used for filing portfolio's on the many different Initiates and
members of the Hand of the Light.  The closed door to the west leads back
into the reception area for the office and beyond that is another door
leading back into the main hallway.

A spacious classroom~
This classroom expands into two rooms, and both rooms more or less
contain the same things.  Rows of identical wooden desks form neat columns
all the way to the back of the classroom and at the front and exactly middle
of the rows of desks, mounted on the wall is a large blackboard which is
covered with chalk writing.  In the corner of the front of the class taking
up a lot of space is the teacher's desk.  Its wooden surface is covered with
papers and books and various large parchments of paper, behind the desk is a
comfortable looking chair, cushioned with a crimson colored fluffy cushion. 
Unlike the hardships experience in many school classrooms, this class is
made comfortable for its students as the desks and chairs aren't cheaply
made or of poor quality but made of good quality wood and with padded
chairs.

An expansive auditorium~
Here, the seats form neat rows, each row on a different level, the
highest level being at the far back of the auditorium.  The chairs are
aligned like this so that the speakers voice carries right to the back of
the auditorium and also so that those using the chair's view is not
obstructed by the people sitting in front of them.  Each chair has a soft
leather cover and cushion to provide its user with the maximum comfort
possible as these lectures can go on for some time.  Here, the seats form

The stage of the auditorium~
The stage is rather large, large enough for a great number of people even
though only a few are needed to make their presentations.  There is a large
and tall table on the stage, which sits right next to the ornately carved
podium on which the speaker stands to make this speech or presentation. 
Directly behind the podium framing its speaker is a large banner of the Hand
of the Light, the Shepard's crook intersecting a blazing sun, depicting the
power of the Light.  Next to the table, in an arranged row, are a number of
comfortable looking chairs used to provide those people assisting the
speaker a place to sit.  From the stage, the rows of chairs at different
heights makes it easy for the speaker to see his crowd and puts less strain
on his voice as he can almost speak normally and be heard by all those
present for his speech.  The walls of the auditorium way above are padded,
to prevent the speaker's words rebounding of the walls and ruining a speech
by echoing every word spoken.

This class is rather large and a very large three-dimensional model of
the known world takes up a large part of the front of the class.  At the
front of the class, before the model is the large teacher's desk, covered in
books, papers and chalk stubs for the outsized blackboard that is mounted on
the near wall.  The desks all form neat rows and columns starting just after
the model and going quite a bit back to the back of the classroom.  At the
back of the classroom there is another large table on which more books and
files lie obviously what is taught in this class is a big subject.  Maps of
smaller areas are hanging at various parts of the walls of the room, there
is a map of the Two Rivers, one of Amador even one of Tar Valon which is
note quite what you would expect to find in a place whose very principles
state that all Tower trained people are witches and Darkfriend alike.

A study hall~
This hall is rather expansive and is used by both members of the Hand and
those aspiring to join the Hand.  There are numerous tables each of which
can seat four people around them and there is enough surface space on the
tables to hold plenty of books and documents as the case may require.  There
is a collection of chairs not around tables that are used simply for light
reading or resting depending on the person occupying it.  The room is
decorated in a crimson red color, its stonewalls are still white but
decorated with crimson silk runners or hanging bolts of material dyed red. 
As with most rooms in this corridor, a large banner hangs from the back of
the room that of the Shepard's crook, colored a deep red.  As well as the
flag there is also a large hanging, depicting an artists impression of the
Fortress of the Light.
