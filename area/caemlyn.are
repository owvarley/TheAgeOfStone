tairen thiefcatcher thieftaker taker catcher man~
a Tairen thieftaker~
Though he does not skulk, this cloaked man cautiously makes his way.
~
A lanky man makes his way through the city as if looking for something,
or someone.  It is not his stature or gait that belies it, but rather his
carefully trimmed goatee that marks him as Tairen.  His clothing is rather
dull in color for Tairen-wear, but his breeches are tight-fit, showing a
well-muscled calf.  He carries an odd staff at his side and seems to sample
the air carefully with each step.

drunken man andoran lout~
a drunken man~
A drunken lout pushes his way through the bar, looking for a fight.
~
The people of Andor are generally a friendly lot, and the citizens of
Caemlyn are no exception.  Generally fair-skinned with light eyes and gold
to blond hair, compared to many of the other nations, Andorans dress quite
conservatively.  This man, unfortunately, seems to have forgotten all this. 
His loud, obnoxious behavior lets it be known that he is looking for a
fight.  The stench of licquor is hard on his breath as he shouts out
obscenities at all who pass his way.

The people of Andor are generally a friendly lot, and the citizens of

A seasoned craftsman is busy here working on fletching some arrows.

The man here works quite diligently at his craft, deftly working the
fletchings into the arrow he is working.  As many walk by, they ask him
questions, and his knowledge into the workings of bow craft seems second to
none.  He does not look to be a native of Andor, as his hawkish features and
sharp angles portray a face borne of the borderlands.  
 
"Of course, you can't just buy the bow without some arrows!  Buy
yourself a quiver and throw it over your shoulder.  A quick first
strike is often a deadly one.  But DO NOT try to engage your enemy in
melee combat with the bow, it might break after a few hits.  And I
don't do repairs."

later with the previous one ordered warm on his tray.  As the innkeeper of
Mergot's Retreat, it is his job to keep his patrons well fed, well
entertained, and well kept.  The rooms for rent at the top of the staircase
are among the finest in Caemlyn.

his starched white apron, with a bright pink face.  When the serving maids
finish taking their orders, they are quick to run them by him before they
send them back into the kitchen.

an Andoran student~
An Andoran student of the Guard goes about his daily routine.
~
Many teen-aged men flock to the capital of Andor, Caemlyn, to traine and
become a part of the royal Queen's Guard.  All are loyal to their Queen and
country, and travel from as far as Baerlon to serve.  The Queen's Guard
holds writ in all of Andor, handing out her majesty's justice with a
balanced conscience.  
But the men now are at ease, resting in the barracks and studying.  The
Queen's Guard are not just enforcers, but rather pillars of Caemlyn
society, being well read and versed in both philosophies and mathematics.

The toymaker sits here, idly tooling with some new work.
~
A younger man with golden Andoran hair and slate grey eyes, his smile
almost fills the room as much as the sun through stained-glass windows.  As
he talks of his wares, one can note the awe and pride he takes in working
his craft, from the detail on the dollies to the intricacy in the puzzles. 
His clothing contains a variety of colors and has a very leafy motif in its
design.  Perhaps the rumors are true, that his magic in the toymaking craft
is derived from a tinkering past.

This kindly young woman is Merelaine Halandor, a pretty young thing who
runs her own stitchery shoppe.  Sew Whats New is her pride and joy, and
whenever a customer enters she brightens like a glowing star.  Her work is

embroiders.  Sometimes, she even receives commisions from outside Andor's
borders, but those are few and far between.  She would be happy to work any
item to fit your liking, at a meager cost.

to learn all he could from the Ogier.  

His is the responsibility of the laws governing housing and zoning.  He

This young warrior from Arafel looks like he is a long way from home.
~
No doubt is this young man from the Borderlands.  He walks with a deadly
gait and looks ready to unsheath his twin swords in a heartbeat.  His hair
is pulled tight into twin braids that fall past his shoulders, a typical
fashion for those of Arafel.  Even the clothes he wears seem unsuitable for
Andor's climate- heavy leathers and furs beneath a fur-lined cloak would
serve him better along the Blight.

~
This heavily armed man walks through the busy streets of Caemlyn with a
singular goal on his mind.  What it might be could be anyone's guess, but
judging by the look on his face you are hoping it is not you he is seeking. 
He brushes by the Andoran men without an apology, but moves with deadly
stride to avoid the women of the city.  Without a nod, a greeting, or an
apology- he just avoids them.  A black topknot of raven black hair reaches
past his waist, and his tanned skin looks like stretched leather.

reaches her chin.  Doe-soft brown eyes look out from the depths of her

Beneath the layers of her fine cloak, a beautiful dress of Andoran cut with
fine embroidery can be seen.  Roses interlace with eachother, marking the
dress' seams.

with a flowing side part.  He strides about the cluttered rummage shop like
a snake in its lair, easily bypassing the piles of artifacts that litter the
floor.  Coin and smiles flash at his whim as he completes transaction after
transaction with the citizens of Caemlyn, and juggles more than a few
customers on his purse.

As she walks the streets with a delicate grace, the tales of gleemen ring
in the ear of a land where the death of a man by a woman is justified unless
proven otherwise- Altara.  The white sheath holding the marriage knife at
her neck is proof of her heritage.  She dresses in somber colors, a drab
tunic falling down past her hips and baggy breeches dress her legs instead
of a skirt.  Like most Altarans, she has dark auburn hair and near-black
eyes.  But what truly makes her stand out from the crowd is the long scar
running from her left ear to her chin, passing through her lips.  She grins
wolfishly at any stare that is too long at her 'beauty mark' and fingers her
rapier idly.

gazebo~
This standing white-washed building has a set of wind chimes crafted from
shells dangling from its center.  The lacework of the walls is entwined with
the yellow flowers of Trueheart.  The gazeebo can hold a few people
comfortably, though a half dozen seems to be the limit. 

While in the gazeebo, you may 'tsay' or 'temote' and only other players
within it will hear/ see what you do.

portal~
For now, a shimmering rift in the Age Lace has been ripped, possibly by
an incredible surge of Balefire from an unknown source.  On the other side
of the portal you see what looks to be a large nursery of sorts, horribly
distorted and with creatures that could only be of the Shadow's brood.  
 
This is a VERY ooc portal to the absolute COOLEST newbie area ever to
be built on a WoT Mud, Brian's Shadowspawn Nursery.  Make sure you keep
your milk far away, or it'll probably be coming through your nose.
Just 'enter portal' and enjoy!

purple~
In an arrangement, the color purple can be used in a variety of different
ways, it can be used to offset other colors in the arrangement or as a focus
all its own.  A color of passion, petals of purple flowers are often laid
upon the beds of newlyweds in the northern countries, while in the south a
splash of violet petals is the challenge of a duel.  So much to be said with
but a simple color, dependent of who listens.  The flowers of Emond's Glory,
various iris, and other plants sell quite popularly.

pink~
Often the flowers of pink are given to young maidens by men in the early

tallowend.

those who require rest a breezy seat to sit in, or those seeking atmosphere
a beautiful view of the night's sky.  Supposedly, when gazing through the

Evening Star Path~
The normal bustle of the busy city life dwindles here away here on
Evening Star Path.  The path calmly makes its way from the central Arrow
Street east towards the Wall Road, running through Caemlyn's Residential
District.  The homes here are built of the swirling grey-streaked stone and
pristine white plaster that make up most of Caemlyn's architecture.  Most of
the houses rise to a second floor, but a few still tend to stay a single
story.  The cobblestone of Evening Star Path flows down a slight decline as
it leads towards Wall Road to the east, while to the west it seems to
incline sharply to merge with Arrow Street and the Northern Arc.  Directly
to the east, Evening Star Path crosses with Braela's Walk before continuing
towards Wall Road.

Junction of Evening Star Path and Braela's Walk~
Cobblestone streets run off in every direction here, at the junction of
Evening Star Path, Braela's Walk, and Bayiin's Court.  In the midst of the
northeast residential district, an intricately laced arch forms over the
five entrances of the streets.  The arches are all interconnected through
the lacework, creating a beautiful white marble star-shaped opening in the
lattice.  Set underneath the lattice work are several benches, each at the
corner of an intersection.  Many of Caemlyn's residents come here to
rendezvous, the beautiful scenery of the area making it a very relaxing
place to talk.  Many small flower gardens line the streets of the
intersection, setting a cascade of wondrous color to accent the area. 
Braela's Walk runs in a north to south direction, leading towards the heart
of Caemlyn.  Evening Star path branches off to the east and west, further
into Caemlyn's residential district.  To the southeast, Bayiin's Court flows
downhill into one of the less travelled and more distinct group of homes in
Caemlyn.

and the walls of the New City can be seen towering besides Wall Road East.

Bayiin's Court~
The cobblestone streets that form a crazy-quilt pattern throughout the
city of Caemlyn flow gracefully down Bayiin's Court.  A district of the
nicer homes of Andor's lords and ladies, the cobblestone along this street
is swept cleaner and kept in pristine repair as compared to the other
streets of Caemlyn.  The homes of Bayiin's Court all rise to a second story
and most are made of flowing white plaster, while some stand of the
grey-washed stone.  Decorating many of the homes are beautiful wreathes of
ivy set with Maiden's Hope and Loversknot, the crimson and white of Andor
displayed proud as their heritage.  Black-lacquered sedan chairs and horses
await outside many of the homes, each chair being worked with silver or gold
crests bearing the family's herald.  Bayiin's Court flows from the northern
intersection of Braela's Walk and Evening Star Path southeasterly towards
the Northern Arc.

Junction of the Northern Arc and Braela's Walk~
The crazy-quilt layout of Caemlyn's New City has streets stretching off
in all directions.  The Northern Arc was one of the first roads built of the
New City, before the Caemlyn Road was taken into the walls and turned into
the Queen's Highway.  The Northern Arc was used as an alternate route to
cross the city, as often the Queen's Highway is teeming with peddlers.  To
the south of the Northern Arc, along Braela's Walk, twin streets curve away
from the main Walk to the east and west.  Beyond those streets, the bustle
of the Queen's Highway can be seen as figures frequently make their way into
view only to quickly disappear.  To the south, the shouts and cries of
hawkers peddling their wares quickly drones out at this distance.  Braela's
Walk leads to the residential district of Caemlyn, and many of her finer
citizens go undisturbed by the visitors and peddlers that fill the centrail
streets.

Junction of Braela's Walk, Murphinian's Arc, and Starblaze Arch~
Braela's Walk makes its path from the Queen's Highway to the south
towards the junction of Wall Road and the Northern Arc to the north.  The
cobblestone street is fairly busy with the flow of Caemlyn's traffic, as
Andor's natural citizens go about their daily business and visitors take in

running off through the hilled landscape of the city.  Murphinian's Arc
curves off to the southeast, leading towards Kellerman Way.  Curving to the
southwest is Starblaze Arch, which connects with Arrow Street near the
Queen's Highway.  Far to the south, within the Inner City, the Royal Palace
lies atop the highest hill of the walled city.  It rests atop the hill like
a glittering jewel, surrounded by the silver-streaked walls of the Inner
City.

Starblaze Arch~
The Starblaze Arch is a primly groomed cobblestone street running a
northeasternly path from the Queen's Highway to the Northern Arc.  The
Starblaze Arch gets its name from the curve the street takes as it passes by
one of Caemlyn's more beautiful gardens.  From inside the garden, beautiful
Starblaze petals set the garden awash in crimson delight, the sweet scent of
pollen filling the air.  Thinly-wrought iron fencing surrounds the garden,
though it too is laced in many beautiful flowers.  Centered in the garden is
a beautiful white marble fountain, with several smaller fountains spraying
water high into the main one's basin.  To the southeast, many small homes
line the street, each of beautiful white plaster and rich red brick to
compliment the colors of the Starblaze Garden.

neighborhood, the homes are all made from either plaster or the red brick
seen throughout the city.  It is mainly the citizens of Caemlyn who travel
these streets, as visitors from other nations would find little of interest

North Ballus Way~
The crazy-quilt layout of Caemlyn's New City has streets stretching off
in all directions.  Following the natural flow of the hills upon which this
city was built, many roads and runs lead between buildings lining the north
of the Northern Arc.  Ballus Way is one such road.  A thin street that
connects the Northern Arc to the Queen's Highway, both streets can be seen
bustling from activity here.  Ballus Way makes its way through the slightly
hilled streets of Caemlyn, providing a pleasant walkway between homes and
shoppes.  To the north, the walls of the New City tower high in the air,
over fifty feet of beautiful silver-streaked stone.  Deeper into Caemlyn to
the southwest, far beyond the Queen's Highway, the Royal Palace rests like a
beautiful jewel atop the rising hills within the Inner City's walls.

Inside the room, everything a traveller would need for a journey waits to
be purchased from the shopkeeper.  Travelling bags, rations, lanterns, and
canteens line the wooden shelves in goodly supply.  This is a small shop; no
exits can be seen save the one leading out the door and onto Lion's Pride
Way.  If ever a traveller needed basic items before leaving the city, this
would be a good place to stock up.  Barrels fill corners of the room,
stocked with coils of rope, tinder, and torches.

Sounds of joy and carousing phil the room as mugs of ale float into the
hands of those eager for a drink.  No musicians can be heard above the
rousing chorus of the common room's patrons, nor can any be seen.  Simple
wooden benches and tables occupy the spaces not taken by the people, and
serving girls flow in and out from the kitchen, doing their best to keep
the patrons happy.  A flight of stairs leads upwards to the inn rooms,
while the kitchen lies north through wide doors.

Hot steam hangs in the air as cooks toil over cooking pots and serving

a large woman bellows instructions at the workers who comply instantly.
The wood floor here in the kitchen has been stained through years of
service; splotches of various drinks soaked into the boards.  The only
exit is to the south, where a roaring crowd can be heard singing some
song.

in ivy and the yellow of Trueheart, enclosing the home and sheltering it
from the shops lining the streets of the Lion's Pride.  A soft feeling of
serenity pervades the property, enchanced by the tiny birds flocking and
chirping in the nearby dogwood saplings.

The Home of Mother Grubb~
This small home is the residence to the woman known as Mother Grubb.  She
is an expert of herbs and other remedies, and the people of Caemlyn often
rely on her when they fall ill.  The common room of her home is set up much
like a waiting room, with twin couches on either side of the room.  The
shades of the windows are closed and the room is lit solely by the pale
light of a few well-placed candles.  The room is beautifully decorated, with
woven rugs and carpets covering the floors and various works of art dressing
the walls.  Even a plaster bust of what must have been old Mother Grubb in
her youth sits upon a small column off in the corner of the room.  A
spiralling staircase leads up to the second floor at the east end of the
room, next to the door to the kitchen.

the records of most of the citizens of Andor's finances.  A lengthy
spiralling staircase leads up, and a second desk lies to the north before
what looks to be a vault.  Thinly-wrought iron guards look to be woven into
the walls near the windows, covering them in a beautiful lacework pattern.

a bright crimson carpet, embroidered with the Lion and Roses of Andor. 
Hanging from each of the walls are paintings of previous men who held the
title of Master of Arms of the Queen's Guard, as well as portraits of former
Captain-Generals.  Twin swords are crossed above the chair at the cherry
desk, both with ceremonial inscriptions in their blades.

delicately glazed with some confectionary.  In the southern wall of the red

parts that belong to the Light only knows.  Upon the tops of the shelves,
stacks of newly inked papers lie, many repetitious in content.  In the

shelves, while different suits of armor are shown off on armor dummies.  The
thick red brick of this building serves to keep the heat in and the cold of
winternight's out.  Set into the eastern wall is a large oaken door,
separating the armorer from the weapons shop.  Separating this room from the
main forge is an iron-clad door to the south, from within, the sounds of
hammer on steel ring clear.

Plastered white buildings with tiled roofs of varying purple and red
follow the road along the south, many of which rise above two floors, with
signs and open windows baring the goods of shops within.  A large building
to the south has twin entrances and varying goods displayed in its windows. 
Here, weapons of varying types line the racks sitting in the window behind
the glass displays and others rest in barrels.  To the west, armors seem
predominantly featured in the windows.  The buildings lining the road to the
north tend to be humbler, still of white plaster but most only a single
floor.  The building north has several older maps hanging in its window,
each faded and worn.  This long stretch of cobblestone is known as the
Queen's Highway, and leads between the Whitebridge and Aringill Gates of
Caemlyn.  The load bustle of the normally busy street is drowned out by the
Merchant's Square, a few dozen feet to the west.

This is one of the many beautiful gardens that decorate the city of

hedges have been meticuously shaped into images of rampant lions, beautiful
women, and valiant knights.  Spiralling through these hedges are the white
and crimson of Maiden's Hope and Loversknot.  Other patches of flowers grow
in small clusters surrounded by tiny white marble walls.  The violet of
Emond's Glory, the white petalled blackthorn bush, heartsblush, and pink
jumpups all do their best to create a most soothing and relaxing atmosphere.

The Queen's Grace~
This is one of the many beautiful gardens that decorate the city of
Caemlyn.  The lush grasses are properly tended and watered daily.  Large
hedges have been meticuously shaped into images of rampant lions, beautiful
women, and valiant knights.  Spiralling through these hedges are the white
and crimson of Maiden's Hope and Loversknot.  Other patches of flowers grow
in small clusters surrounded by tiny white marble walls.  The violet of
Emond's Glory, the white petalled blackthorn bush, heartsblush, and pink
jumpups all do their best to create a most soothing and relaxing atmosphere.
The thinly-wrought iron gate opens to the southwest.

The Moneylender's Vault~
Outside the large vault lies a fine oak desk.  It contrasts strongly
against the black and white tiled floor, though the iron guards covering the
windows seem to pull the look together.  The lacework pattern the
thinly-wrought iron forms over the windows is exquisitely crafted, creating
a floral motif.  A spiralling staircase leads up towards the south end of
the large bank and the white marble walls are interrupted by the exit there,
as well.

In the Light of Friends~
This is a large buildiung with white plaster walls.  Varying pieces of
art hang from the walls, between thinly veiled windows dressed in pink lace.
This looks to be the entertaining quarters of a humble household, the smell
of hickory smoke wafting from the northern door notes it as the kitchen. 
Differing rugs cover the floor and staircase, from stout Andoran wool to
Domani silks.  With the soft light offered by burning vanilla-scented
candles, this room has a very comfortable and safe feeling to it.

Outside Mergot's Retreat~
The large red brick building to the east bears a large sign out front
that declares it Mergot's Retreat.  The building stands at three stories and
is dressed with deep cherry wood panelling outside its door and windows. 
From within, the merry singing of a gleeman's voice can be heard mingling
with the off-key accompaniment of several tipsy men.  Hickory smoke rises
from the chimney and the smell of spiced potatoes and meat wafts in the air.
To the north, a large stable yard looks well-tended to as several boys look
to care after the many steeds posted.

Mergot's Stable Yard~
Horses are lead to and fro within the stable yard by young boys who tend
to their every need.  Small boys heft oats and hay while others carry
buckets of water to the large stable to the east.  Many horses are outside,
tied to tall posts while the young boys brush and comb them in earnest.  The
stable and stalls east are not open to the public, but many visitors leave
their steeds here during their stay in Caemlyn.  To the south, a small
walkway leads to the Mergot's Retreat, a large building of red brick that
echoes of merriment from within.

Mergot's Retreat~
This old brick building is rich with the scent of hickory smoke and

room of Mergot's Retreat a comforting feel to it.  Several round tables
encircle a large fireplace with a fire burning in its hearth.  From behind
the bar, tavern maids ready drinks upon serving trays and bustle from the
kitchens.  A spiralling staircase leads upwards to the second floor of this
old building.

On the Mark~
A small building of white stone, 'On the Mark' is the fletchery shop of
choice in Caemlyn, favored by everyone from game hunters to sportsmen to
seasoned adventurers.  Targets of various sizes line the south walls, as do
a number of different types of bows line the north wall.  Before the counter
to the west rest several half-sized barrels, each filled with headless arrow
shafts that vary in size.  Behind the counter, several arrowhead types are
presented on a plaque and a crate filled with quivers lies.  The windows in
the east wall show the bustle of Arrow Street, as Andoran citizens politely
greet eachother and nod as they stroll by.

The Caemlyn Pound~
The Pound of Caemlyn is where the homeless dogs and other animals are
brought to be cared for and hopefully trained into potential pets for the
loving homes of Caemlyn.  Little wooden pens hold the puppies in groups,
while large feeding bowls are placed within to keep them fed well.  The
keeper of the pound is busy looking after them, while still trying to
placate the children mobbing the store.

This is the humble shop of Caemlyn's foremost limner.  Manuscripts and
tomes line the bookshelves that make rows in the building.  Posted to the
walls of the shop are maps of various countries, which mark the contents of
the scrolls in the shelves below them.  The wooden support beams that
cross-hatch the ceiling of this gray stone building are intricately carved
with heralds from many of the different nations of the world, both new and
old.  A large counter with small stools sits up against the eastern wall of
the store, probably for the convinience of the patrons.

Little is it known that the limner of Caemlyn is actually one of the eyes
and ears of the White Tower's Brown Ajah.  This little room is where she
scribes most of her work, but also serves as a meeting place whenever the
Aes Sedai are in need.  Here, they can come and be undisturbed from the
worries of the outside world for a time or catch up on any bits of news the
limner might have caught wind of.  This room is sparsely furnished, though
what need is there of comfort for the Brown Ajah when the solace of a quiet
place to read is offered?

Hallway in the Barracks~
The walk down the hallway in the squires barracks has the walls covered
printings of standard heralds and regulations the potential Queen's
Guardsmen must be aware of.  The sounds of student's voices permeate from
the doors down the corridor as they discuss everything from the day's
lessons to some of the ladies-in-waiting that wander the Palace halls. 
Several doors are set into both the north and south walls running down the
corridor, and the large oaken door to the west leads into the center of the
compound.

makes up the building to the east, accessible by a large oaken door in the

The stables hold up to a dozen large stalls, suitable for holding a few
horses in each, and a few lads run about them making sure the horses are
well-tended.

Before the Inner City Gates~
Caemlyn's Inner City stretches out before the gates.  As if the New City
was not beautiful enough, the Inner City is a marvel of Ogier craftsmanship.
The beautiful towers and domes of the city are not merely works of
perfection by themselves, but as a city they act as a model of glory for all
to emulate.  Silver-streaked towers rise upon the hilled landscape,
gradually leading towards the Royal Palace.  The Queen's Guard regally
stroll the streets, keeping watch on the city.  From the homes of the Inner
City, Andor's lords and ladies make their way going about their daily
pleasantries, all dressed in the finest rainments gold can buy.  
 
To the east is the temporary entrance to the `RQueen's Guard Barracks`w.
To the west is the temporary entrance to the trainer.

The Wondrous Works of Mackus Fel~
A beautiful shoppe filled with all sorts of toys and baubles for children
to play with and entertain themselves.  Wooden puzzles line the walls,
dollies sit on shelves, and hundreds of iron-worked tavern puzzles hang from
bits in the oaken crossbeams.  The toy shoppe permeates an air of glee, from
the dozens of awe-inspired children that sample the works alone, in groups,
or with their parents.  The beautiful windows stream with a dazzling array
of light, as visions of the Queen and heroes from stories are brought to
life in stained-glass fixtures.  The door north leads outside to the Queen's
Highway.

scents, each open to allow their fragrance to waft on the air.  The large
windows in the eastern wall spill light into this small shop allowing for
casual browsing at a glance.

This is the main hall of the Mason's Authority of Caemlyn.  Thick
crossbeams of Andoran fir cross the ceilings and line the walls, adding
extra support to the tight brickwork that makes up this establishment. 
Tables and chairs are set neatly for customers to wait at, as several desks
are set up at the south end of the hall to do business.  Atop the waiting
tables are several tomes describing the different building techniques of
other cultures- materials, climates, and tastes.  Through the northern door
lies Caemlyn's residential district, True Man's Path.

Tilaen's Folly~
The normal hubhub of the city quiets some along Tilaen's Folly, which
lends itself to be more of a residential area than the rest of the
commercialized city.  Few shops line this low-hilled road, as most of the
residences are beautiful white plaster with worked wood framing.  Two
intersections find their way at both the eastern and western ends of this
road, the one to the west seeming to lead further into the heart of the
city, while the one to the east leads towards more homes and residences. 
Lining the white paving stones leading to a large oak door in the building
to the north are several rows of beautiful flowers.  The building itself
stands at two stories, with a wave-like rhythm applied to the plastered
walls.  Many of the more affluent citizens of Caemlyn come and go as they
please from the inn, everyone leaving appearing as though they enjoyed
themselves immensely.

Boxes, barrels, sacks, packs and bags lie everywhere in this cluttered
room.  The interior of this shop looks to just be in shambles.  Pieces of
armor poke up out of boxes that lay next to barrels full of swords and
umbrellas.  Objects of all varieties line the shelves and hang from the
ceiling.  Porcelain plates, straw dolls, illuminated manuscripts, and other
antiquities are thrown together in this makeshift shoppe.  The bustle of
Caemlyn's Arrow Street resounds from the door to the east, while a door to
the west is blocked off by a long wooden counter.

East Turanin Way~
The crazy-quilt streets of Caemlyn roll over the hilly landscape by
stretches of cobblestone roads.  Turanin Road runs from the Wall Road West
to East, crossing through the busy streets of Lion's Pride Way and Arrow
Street.  Tall buildings rise to the south and north of the street, varying
between red brick, white plaster, and gray stone.  Some rise to heights of
two stories, some three.  To the east is a small intersection, and Turanin
Road ends at the mighty walls surrounding the New City.

Braela's Vigil~
This small garden is perhaps one of the most colorful in all of the city.
Bushes and flowers of all kinds run along the smooth cobblestone paths, all
leading towards a central fountain.  Surrounding the garden is a a thin iron
fence, wreathed with ivy and Trueheart.  Many of Caemlyn's older and more
venerable citizens come here for respite from the bustle of the city,
enjoying the calm tranquility of the garden.  The garden is alive with
flowers; crimson and white calma blossoms blend with the pink of jumpup,
Trueheart and Emond's Glory add vibrant yellows and violets, even the even
the green needles of the smaller leatherleaf saplings seem more lush in this
park.

A darkened alleyway~
In this small alley behind the shop, the light of the noonday sun is
neverpresent, as the tall walls of the buildings encompassing it near block
out all light from above.  It is a crowded opening betweem the two
buildings, filled with excess broken furniture and belongings, as well as a
few boarded crates.  Set into the walls of the shop to the north is a large
cellar door.  The cellar door is slanted almost flat to the ground, its hasp
held tight by thick bolts and and an rusty iron lock bigger than most man's
hands.

Beneath the shop~
The cellar to this old shop is long and wide, with much of the space
taken up by brick columns supporting the ceiling.  The columns flare out
from narrow bases, creating thick vaultings as they grow to five times the
size of their base as the reach the ceiling.  Though the cellar does not
appear to have been used for ages and is quite sparse of furnishings, it
still seems quite crowded by the columns that stretch towards the ceilings. 
At the east end of this cellar is an aged stairwell, that does not appear to
have been used in quite some time.  Several of the wooden steps are broken
through and no attempt to fix them has been made.  To the south end of the
basement, a set of stairs rise from the dusty floor towards the cellar door
leading outside.  The walls of the cellar are all of the same red brick that
makes up the columns that dominate the space, all except the eastern wall.

Faule's Well Way~
An ogier-built basin that stretches the length of the road of Faule's
Well Way leads from the Inner City Circle to the Queen's Highway.  At each
end of the basin, a winged male statue rises from the fountain, carved in
beautiful silver-streaked white marble.  To the south, Faule's Well Way ends
at the Inner City Circle, while to the north it crosses the Queen's Highway
and becomes Braela's Walk.  The cobblestone of the road has been dutifully
cleaned and shows very little wear from traffic, though the streets are
quite filled with the residents of the city and visitors.  The traffic grows
tight on the Queen's Highway to the north, as peddlers and hawkers mingle
with the citizens of the city.  Within the Inner City to the south, the
Royal Palace lies atop the highest hill of the walled city.  It rests atop
the hill like a glittering jewel, surrounded by the silver-streaked walls of
the Inner City.

Peregrine Park~
This park is set closest to the Wall Road East of the city of Caemlyn. 
As such, it receives more cool and refreshing shadow than the other parks of
the city.  The sun only sets this park alight when it is directly overhead,
otherwise casting deep shade by the walls and trees within.  Though the
garden is otherwise dominated by an imposing fountain, sweet smelling
flowers wreath the fencing and decorate the plants within.  Many young
children run about this garden with play swords or playing hide-and-find,
while it seems empty of adults who are not busy chaperoning.  Gates in the
iron fencing lead back to Caemlyn's residential streets.

Andel's Leatherworks and Acquisitions~
This small shop has shelves lining three of the walls, all of which are
packed with different items.  The predominant display, is that of leather
goods, from bracers to vests, hardened leather scabbards to soft knee high
boots.  Setting on the counter are pieces of leather and a few thick
needles, as well as some other leather tools.  Aside from the displayed
leather goods, there are bits of silver work and steel items.  A few swords
and assorted bits of armor rest in one corner, all well oiled and taken care
of as if the owner just dropped them off just an hour ago.  Set in the
middle of the room is a small display case, inside are some gold and silver
jewelry, earrings and rings as well as necklaces and bracelets.  The whole
of the store smells pleasent, as there is incense burning somewhere and
there is no dust on any of the shelves, the owner must be very proud of his
establishment.  Behind the small counter that serves as both a worktable and
conversation center, there is a sign set on the wall.

Lord's Engravings and Smithing~
This large-sized shop consists simply of a large open space which is
clean and well kept.  The front wall is lined with large windows that are
kept open during the day to let the breeze blow through the shop.  A large
forge bellows and several anvils of varying sizes take up most of the back
left corner.  The walls at this part of the shop abruptly end, opening the
space up to the outside air.  A high fence closes the shop in, and the
corner is shaded from the sun by the roof extending outwards.  Even on the
coldest of days, the heat from the forge warms the entire shop, despite
having no back wall.  On hotter days, the wisdom of the design shines
through, allowing a constant breeze to flow.  Several waist high racks frame
the area, filled with tongs, hammers, and other various blacksmith tools.  A
small counter stands closer to the front of the shop, framed by several
stands holding various pieces of armor and shields, as well as swords, axes,
and other weapons.

Junction of Bull's Path and Inner City Circle~
The Inner City Circle is probably one of the most level streets in all of
Caemlyn.  Smooth cobblestone laid down over curves of one of Caemlyn's
highest hills, this street encircles the walls of the Inner City and
provides a good vantage point for looking down on the New City.  The New
City lies to the north, with gates leaving from Caemlyn far to the north,
east, and west.  A central street running throughout the city is the Queen's
Highway, running east to west, and it is teeming with people.  Lion's Pride
Way leads northwards from the gate into the Inner City to the east.  A wide
avenue leads downhill to the west.  Bull's Path is wide enough to support
two wagons with enough room for pedestrians to travel along as well.  The
wide avenue leads towards the Lugard Gate, where a bustle of Caemlyn's
citizens eagerly await merchants and peddlers from Murandy.  All long the
Inner City walls are set beautiful gardens, blossoming the crimson of of
Loversknot and the ivory of Maiden's Hope.  Inner City Circle continues to
the east and south, surrounding the beautiful Ogier-worked architecture
within the silver-streaked walls.

Bull's Path~
The hardened white marble cobblestones of this street are tightly knit. 
Leading to the east and west, Bull's Path is an avenue wide enough to
support two wagons with generous girth for pedestrians as well.  Merchants
attempt to work their way into the city to the west, for some small respite
from their long travels, only to be mobbed by the people of Caemlyn
expecting goods from far-off lands.  The storefronts and homes along Bull's
Path are mainly of white marble and gray stone, blending with the benches
and walkways along the streets.  Vibrant crimson and white banners depicting
the rampant Lion of Andor hang from the second story of many of the
buildings, giving glory unto Her Majesty, the Queen.  Bull's Path rises to
the east, flowing up one of Andor's natural hills towards the Inner City. 
Wrapped in silver-streaked white marble walls, the Inner City was built by
the Ogier and is home to much of Caemlyn's finer architecture.  Nestled in
the bossom of the Inner City, the Royal Palace rises like a sparkling jewel
set against the shining sun.

West Hill Rise~
West Hill Rise follows the slope of one of the higher hills in Caemlyn. 
Tightly-knit cobblestones lead up a sharp incline towards the hill that
encircles the Inner City Circle to the east.  Lining the Rise to the south
is a series of gardens set in white marble planters.  The gardens bloom
fragrant flowers that almost flow off the drop down to the terraced streets
below.  Low Rise Terrace runs almost parallel to West Hill Rise, down below,
but is longer and has a more gradual incline.  Still, the gardens leading up
towards the Inner City Circle are vibrant in their washes of crimson and
white- heartsblush and calma lillies mirroring the colors of the banners
hanging from the homes along the north side of the street.  Blowing proudly
in the wind, the banners often hang from windows or banner poles set in the
walls of the second-story homes of white marble.

Northeast Corner of Inner City Plaza~
A large, circular plaza opens wide before the South Gate of Caemlyn's
Inner City.  To the north, the gates of the Inner City and the towers and
palaces within reach to awe-inspiring heights, gleaming brightly in the noon
sun.  Here, wonder and amazement befall all in Inner City Plaza.  While the
backdrop of the Inner City and all within provide the setting, the Plaza
itself is the stage as entertainers from this city and others drown
themselves in the adulation and applause of the spectators.  The Plaza is
filled with people enjoying the day's entertainments and visitors to the
city enjoy the merriment after their travels.  Inner City Circle spreads out
to the east and west, encircling the walls of the Inner City.  As it is
built upon the crest of one of Caemlyn's highest hills, it is one of the
more level streets in the city.  From here, all roads flow downhill towards
the low-rolling hilled landscape of the city.

Lion's Pride Way~
The Lion's Pride Way is the long road stretching between the Tar Valon
Gate and the Inner City.  It is the second longest road in all of Caemlyn,
being surpassed only by the Queen's Highway, though it is easily the most
colorful and well-decorated road.  The beautiful cobblestone road leads deep
into the city, and is hedged the whole way by small gardens laced with the
crimsom and white of Loversknot and Maiden's Hope.  The busy streets bustle
with life, as hawkers mill about, shouting, screaming, and peddling their
wares from the walkways, while sedan chairs are drawn with lords and ladies
throughout the city.  Buildings of differing architecture, from red brick to
white plaster, follow the Pride along the west with billowing banners
depicting the Lion of Andor flagrantly hanging from the windows.  To the
south cobblestone streets begin to rise their way up the country's subtle
hills, leading towards the Inner City and the Royal Palace.  A large
stableyard opens to the east before a large inn finely dressed in white
stone.  Standing at three stories, a sign on the outside of the inn
proclaims it as 'The Crown of Roses'.

Stableyard of the Crown of Roses~
The stableyard outside this large inn is neatly kept.  Stablemen dressed
in the Crown of Rose's livery go about taking care of the needs of the
horses and carriages under their care.  The Crown of Roses is one of the
grandest inns of all of Caemlyn.  The building is crafted of pristine white
marble, with few wooden crossbeams that serve for decorative purposes only. 
Atop the door inside, a large sign is painted with an elegant golden crown
wreathed by dozens of roses.  The inn stands at three stories high, with
cornerstone reliefs in the marble that are reminiscent of the inn's sign. 
The inn seems favored by many lords and ladies, finely dressed and laughing
gaily as they leave.  The bustle of Lion's Pride Way is heavy in the air to
the west, as Caemlyn's citizens go about their daily business.

Songs for the Circling Spirit~
The gray stone of this building is rather stark and bland in contrast to
the bright and cheery nature of this shop.  Musical instruments of all kinds
hang from different pegs and sit on easels all about the building.  Colorful
light catchers hang from the fir rafters in the common room of this store,
streaming light into a myriad of blending colors onto the walls and
instruments.  Behind a fir countertop, the shop's proprietor sits on a
stool, waxing the strings of a long wooden instrument.  Low Rise Terrace
lies out the door to the east.

A Warm Kitchen~
An open window allows the warmth of the day to penetrate the kitchen to
this spacious home.  All the common luxuries one might take for granted in a
lord's home are here, including a cast-iron oven, an indoor water-pump and
hundreds of different utensils used in cooking.  White plaster walls are
lined with shelves holding utensils and spices, almost overflowing with
items.  The hardwood floors have seen their share of age, being worn to pale
and splintered wood on some spots.  Through an open door to the south, a
parlor for entertaining guests sits.  A basket for taking up donations for
the poor of the city lies within.

Pearman's Lane~
The sharp incline of Pearman's Lane curves to the southeast.  Gardens
line the cobblestone street, white marble flower beds blossom red and white
flowers with the Lion of Andor etched in the marble base.  The Lane is
remarkably well-kept, those living upon it must take great care in keeping
it clean.  Within a large fenced-off garden to the east, a white marble
fountain streams water into the sky from a white marble basin.  The
buildings on the western side of the street are crafted of red brick and
white-washed gray stone.  The Queen's Highway lies a few paces to the north,
and the two-story homes overlooking it proudly fly the Rampant Lion of Andor
from their upper windows.  To the southeast, Pearman's Lane crosses Needle
Arc, where the pedestrian traffic seems to divide.

Junction of the Queen's Highway and West Hill Rise~
The bustle of traffic fills the air along the Queen's Highway of Caemlyn.
Black lacquered sedan chairs make their way through the streets, the heavy
clopping of horseshoes loud against the old cobblestone road.  Peddler's and
hawker's shouts fill the air, each trying to convince shoppers that their
goods are superior while maintaining the lowest cost.  People make their way
through the busy Caemlyn streets further into the city, crossing the Queen's
Highway between the raised beds of flowers splitting it into parallel
boulevards.  This long stretch of cobblestone leads between the Whitebridge
and Aringill Gates of Caemlyn.  The south is lined by one of the many
beautiful gardens of Caemlyn, the crimson and white of Loversknot and
Maiden's Hope woven delicately amongst the ivy twining the thinly wrought
iron gates enclosing them.  Plastered white buildings with tiled roofs of
varying purple and red follow the Highway to the north, many of which rise
above two floors, with signs and open windows baring the goods of shops
within.

The Whitebridge Gate~
To the north and south, two large towers frame the Whitebridge Gate of
Caemlyn.  The guards stationed here glance at every traveller, noble and
commoner alike, before dismissing them as harmless.  The cobbled road has
been worn smooth from decades of travellers and guardsmen passing these
gates.  To the west, the cobbled road continues onward to the town of
Carysford and beyond.  East of these gates lies Caemlyn, the capitol of
Andor.  The Queen's Highway stretches the length of the city to the east
towards the Aringill Gate.  The wide boulevard in split into two lanes by
beautifully tended gardens.  A poster has been tacked to one of the
guardhouse doors.

The Whitebridge Gate Guardhouse~
This Andoran guardhouse is one of the many posts around Caemlyn
maintained by the Queen's Guard.  Manned at all times, it provides a certain
amount of safety for those inside the walls.  The guards must slip somewhere
else in the city for rest; there are no beds to be seen.  Leading upwards, a
ladder reaches to the top of the tower where guards are stationed, while
south leads to the Whitebridge Gate.  The heavily mortared seams of the
thick stonework would suggest these walls might even survive a second
Breaking.

Atop the Guard Tower~
Atop this guard tower, one can see the Whitebridge Gate and the patches
of farmland that lay beyond it.  A wall of cut stone rises to the waist,
giving adequate safety from accidentally falling over the side.  The floor
is of the same stone as the wall, dull grey and course, yet strong against
the forces of nature.  A ladder leading downwards is the only exit apparent.
The heavily mortared seams of the thick stonework would suggest these walls
might even survive a second Breaking.

of farmland that lay beyond it.  A wall of cut stone rises to the waist,
giving adequate safety from accidentally falling over the side.  The floor
is of the same stone as the wall, dull grey and course, yet strong against
the forces of nature.  A ladder leading downwards is the only exit apparent.
The heavily mortared seams of the thick stonework would suggest these walls
might even survive a second Breaking.

The Queen's Highway~
Spilling into one of the most beautiful cities in all the realms, crowds
lurch and push their way in a number of directions, making the flow of
traffic difficult.  The capital of Andor, Caemlyn is a city built upon the
land of rolling hills, its fine cobblestone streets weaving between and up
the hills in such a way that the deeper one gets into the city, the higher
the ground upon which they stand.  Set atop the highest hill of the city,
the Royal Palace rests like the crowning jewel of the beautiful crown of the
Inner City to the south.  Gleaming white spires and golden domes rise from
deep within its walls, sparkling brightly in the light of the sun.  People
make their way through the busy Caemlyn streets further into the city,
crossing the Queen's Highway between the raised beds of flowers splitting it
into parallel boulevards.  The Queen's Highway is a long streth of a
cobblestone road leading between the Whitebridge and the Aringill Gates. 
Twin roads branch off from the Highway to the east, leading north and south,
while to the west, the Whitebridge Gate leads back outside the city, to the
Caemlyn Road.

Junction of the Queen's Highway, the Northern Arc, and Wall Road~
People make their way through the busy Caemlyn streets further into the
city, crossing the Queen's Highway between the raised beds of flowers
splitting it into parallel boulevards.  The Queen's Highway is a long
stretch of a cobblestone road leading between the Whitebridge and the
Aringill Gates.  Twin roads branch off from the Highway, leading to the
north and south.  The southern cobblestone road leads up and through the
other crazy-quilt streets of Caemlyn, straight towards the gates of the
Inner City and the Royal Palace.  Shops and squares line the Queen's
Highway, as hawkers and peddlers shout from the walkways.  Black lacquered
Sedan chairs are quick to make their way through the streets, stopping
periodically to allow the flow of pedestrian traffic to continue.  The
western Whitebridge gate lies to the west, guarded by several members of the
Queen's Guard, and the great Northern Arc begins making its way east across
the city to the north.

Junction of the Queen's Highway and Pearman's Lane~
The bustle of traffic fills the air along the Queen's Highway of Caemlyn.
Black lacquered sedan chairs make their way through the streets, the heavy
clopping of horseshoes loud against the old cobblestone road.  Peddler's and
hawker's shouts fill the air, each trying to convince shoppers that their
goods are superior while maintaining the lowest cost.  People make their way
through the busy Caemlyn streets further into the city, crossing the Queen's
Highway between the raised beds of flowers splitting it into parallel
boulevards.  This long stretch of cobblestone leads between the Whitebridge
and Aringill Gates of Caemlyn.  The south is lined by one of the many
beautiful gardens of Caemlyn, the crimson and white of Loversknot and
Maiden's Hope woven delicately amongst the ivy twining the thinly wrought
iron gates enclosing them.  Plastered white buildings with tiled roofs of
varying purple and red follow the Highway to the north, many of which rise
above two floors, with signs and open windows baring the goods of shops
within.

between cutlers, tailors and every vendor possible on Needle Street.

Junction of the Queen's Highway and Lion's Pride Way~
At the junction of the Queen's Highway and Lion's Pride Way, the flow of
traffic almost comes to a halt.  The busy intersection crosses two of
Caemlyn's busiest streets, one the span between the Whitebridge and Aringill
Gates of Caemlyn, the other the road leading from the Tar Valon Gate to the
Royal Palace of Andor.  Merchants and their carts line the corners of the
streets, shouting fevently in hopes of outselling their competitors, while
lords and ladies carefully pick their way through the streets.  Easily
visible is the Queen's Guard, dressed in the bright crimson and white of all
servants of the Queen.  Shops and homes line the streets in all directions,
as well as a few gardens and monuments along the way.

The Merchant's Square~
The traffic crossing the Merchant Square of Caemlyn nearly comes to a
halt.  Called the Merchant Square as it marks the middle of the Queen's
Highway, it is here that the shouts of hawkers and peddlers nearly deafen
those trying to pass.  Along the Queen's Highway, hundreds of varieties of
goods can be bought from the merchants and farmers lining the roads.  The
people of Caemlyn flock to the Square full of coin and barter, ready to fill
their sacks and wagons for as little cost as possible.  Coppery-skinned
Domani to fair-haired Cairhiens fill the streets as well as loyal Andorans,
creating a vast melting pot of people.  Still, the Queen's Guard stands out
in their crimson and white livery, armed with the weapons of Caemlyn's
finest forges.

Plastered white buildings with tiled roofs of varying purple and red
follow the road along the south, many of which rise above two floors, with
signs and open windows baring the goods of shops within.  A large building
to the south has twin entrances and varying goods displayed in its windows. 
Here, armors of varying types dress mannequins behind the glass displays and
helmets hang from hooks.  To the east, weapons seem predominantly featured
in the windows.  The buildings lining the road to the north tend to be
humbler, still of white plaster but most only a single floor.  The building
north has several older maps hanging in its window, each faded and worn. 
This long stretch of cobblestone is known as the Queen's Highway, and leads
between the Whitebridge and Aringill Gates of Caemlyn.  The loud bustle of
the normally busy street is drowned out by the Merchant's Square, directly
to the west.

Junction of the Queen's Highway, Braela's Walk and Faule's Well Way~
Plastered white buildings with tiled roofs of varying purple and red
follow the road on all sides before leading to this intersection.  A small
market opens wide as the Queen's Highway crosses cobblestone with Braela's
Walk.  The northern street of Braela's Walk leads towards the residential
district of Caemlyn.  Leading east and west is the Queen's Highway, which
connects the span of Caemlyn from the Whitebridge to Aringill Gates.  The
city is alive with the bustle of people.  The golden-haired citizens of the
city mix freely with the many travellers from other lands.  Copper-skinned
Domani go about their business in Caemlyn, as do the stoic Shienari,
arrogant Tairens, and flirtatious Mayeners.  Sedan chairs of all colors and
sizes are drawn up the streets carrying forth their owners.  The hilly
cobblestone streets of Caemlyn branch off in all directions, causing the
city to have a crazy-quilt design.  The land rises higher the further south
one progresses, until the walls of the Inner City can be seen like a plush
ivory cushion encircling the Royal Palace of Caemlyn.

People mill about the street heading in many different directions, the
citizens of Caemlyn smiling and offering pleasantries to the visitors from
neighboring nations.  To the west, a small market square opens at the
intersection of the Queen's Highway and Braela's Walk.  Kellerman Way
crosses paths with the Highway to the east as people brush by eachother on
their way without stopping.

Highway, as hawkers and peddlers shout from the walkways.  Black lacquered
Sedan chairs are quick to make their way through the streets, stopping
periodically to allow the flow of pedestrian traffic to continue.  The
eastern Aringill gate lies to the east, guarded by several members of the
Queen's Guard, and the great Northern Arc begins making its way west across
the city to the north.

The Queen's Highway~
Spilling into one of the most beautiful cities in all the realms, crowds
lurch and push their way in a number of directions, making the flow of
traffic difficult.  The capital of Andor, Caemlyn is a city built upon the
land of rolling hills, its fine cobblestone streets weaving between and up
the hills in such a way that the deeper one gets into the city, the higher
the ground upon which they stand.  Set atop the highest hill of the city,
the Royal Palace rests like the crowning jewel of the beautiful crown of the
Inner City to the south.  Gleaming white spires and golden domes rise from
deep within its walls, sparkling brightly in the light of the sun.  People
make their way through the busy Caemlyn streets further into the city,
crossing the Queen's Highway between the raised beds of flowers splitting it
into parallel boulevards.  The Queen's Highway is a long streth of a
cobblestone road leading between the Whitebridge and the Aringill Gates. 
Twin roads branch off from the Highway to the west, leading north and south,
while to the east, the Aringill Gate leads back outside the city, to the
Caemlyn Road.

The Aringill Gate~
To the north and south, two large towers frame the Aringill Gate of
Caemlyn.  The guards stationed here glance at every traveller, noble and
commoner alike, before dismissing them as harmless.  The cobbled road has
been worn smooth from decades of travellers and guardsmen passing these
gates.  To the east, the cobbled road continues on through a small town
before leading towards Aringill.  The Queen's Highway stretches the length
of the city to the west towards the Whitebridge Gate.  The wide boulevard is
split into two lanes by beautifully tended gardens.  A poster has been
tacked to one of the guardhouse doors.

The Aringill Gate Guardtower~
This Andoran guardhouse is one of the many posts around Caemlyn
maintained by the Queen's Guard.  Manned at all times, it provides a certain
amount of safety for those inside the walls.  The guards must slip somewhere
else in the city for rest; there are no beds to be seen.  Leading upwards, a
ladder reaches to the top of the tower where guards are stationed, while
south leads to the Aringill Gate.  The heavily mortared seams of the thick
stonework would suggest these walls might even survive a second Breaking.

Atop the Guard Tower~
Atop this guard tower, one can see the Aringill Gate and the patches of
farmland that lay beyond it.  A wall of cut stone rises to the waist, giving
adequate safety from accidentally falling over the side.  The floor is of
the same stone as the wall, dull grey and course, yet strong against the
forces of nature.  A ladder leading downwards is the only exit apparent.

Rampant Lane~
Rolling downhill from west to east, Rampant Lane follows the natural
curves of the city of Caemlyn.  Like many of the streets of the city,
tightly fit cobblestone offers a firm foundation for the people who tread
over it.  Rampant Lane runs from the center of the New City to the west and
ends at the Wall Road.  Along the street, homes and plentiful establishments
line the way.  Their exteriors of white marble or marbled gray stone.  This
close to the Inner City, the homes and buildings are fancifully decorated,
with various reliefs in the walls and flower gardens aside the street.  To
the east, Rampant Lane intersects with Drayla Court, leading to the northern
quarters of the city.  Cutting into the sloping hills of the landscape, West
Hill Rise lies to the west.

The Queen's Blessing~
This is the large common room of the Queen's Blessing.  Twin hearths lie
parallel to each other, one set in the east wall and one the west, both
blazing in a fury to keep the large room warm.  Dark wood panelling covers
the walls, with silver sconces setting the room alight.  From the kitchen,
the smell of roasting beef and baking bread wafts, filling the nose of the
empty-stomached.  A pair of doors swing open to the entrance of the kitchen,
but are blocked off by the counter, employees only.  A door in the western
wall leads out to the stables.

light down the hallway and reflecting off the many mirrors.

Wall Road West~
The crazy-quilt layout of Caemlyn's New City has streets stretching off
in all directions.  Following the natural flow of the hills upon which this
city was built, many roads and runs lead between the assortment of buildings
in the city, making it nearly maze-like to traverse.  The Wall Road runs
along the outskirts of the city, a dozen paces from the towering walls
surrounding the New City.  Still, the cobblestone roads flow along the
city's curves, intersected at intervals by streets running deeper within. 
The hills of Caemlyn flow and roll lowly throughout the city, rising higher
to the south where the Royal Palace rests atop the highest, like a
glittering crown against the sun.

Junction of West Hill Rise and Rampant Lane~
The capital of Andor lies atop a series of low-rising hills.  Cobblestone
streets rich with life and flair mark Caemlyn as one of the most beautiful
cities in the realms.  West Hill Rise cuts into one of the steeper descents
of Andor's hills, following the curve from the Northern Arc to the Inner
City Circle.  Here lies an intersection with Rampant Lane, a street that
rolls downhill to the west from Arrow Street in the center of the city. 
Along the intersection in all directions, buildings line the streets. 
Crafted of gray-washed stone or white plaster, the buildings have roofs of
purple or red tiles or airy domes.  The bustle of the city grows to the
north, south and east, as the main roadways see more traffic than the more
residential squares.  Hanging from the windows of some of the homes here are
banners and gardens, each proudly showing the colors of the Queen and Andor,
crimson and white.  Past a small building to the west, Rampant Lane
intersects with the street before the New City Wall, Wall Road West.

Lion's Pride Way~
The Lion's Pride Way is the long road stretching between the Tar Valon
Gate and the Royal Palace.  It is the second longest road in all of Caemlyn,
being surpassed only by the Queen's Highway, though it is easily the most
colorful and well-decorated road.  The beautiful cobblestone road leads deep
into the city, and is hedged the whole way by small gardens laced with the
crimson and white of Loversknot and Maiden's Hope.  Along the road, Andorans
go about their daily business while smiling and greeting eachother warmly. 
A long and narrow square is filled with birds of different colors to the
east and is lined by a thinly-wrought iron gate.  The road that skirts the
city of Caemlyn, the Wall Road, continues off to the west, curling through
the trimmed grasses and bushes that line the walls.

The long road of the Lion's Pride Way stretches from the Tar Valon Gate
through the length of the city towards the Royal Palace of Caemlyn.  Rich
crimson banners trimmed in gold depict the Queen's colors hanging from many
of the windows of shops and homes along the way.  When the Daughter-Heir and
First Prince are sent to the White Tower to train, it is the Lion's Pride
Way that leads them through the city to northgate.  During these times, the
beloved people of Caemlyn line the way, throwing rose petals and rice to
mark their passage.  To the south, a thick garden splits the Pride in half,
with lush hedges and flowers blooming from within.  Branching off to the
east side of the garden, Arrow Street leads deep within the heart of the
city and the Wall Road east follows Caemlyn's curved borders.

land of rolling hills, its fine cobblestone streets weaving between and up
the hills in such a way that the deeper one gets into the city, the higher
the ground upon which they stand.  Set atop the highest hill of the city,
the Royal Palace rests like the crowning jewel of the beautiful crown of the
Inner City to the south.  Gleaming white spires and golden domes rise from
deep within its walls, sparkling brightly in the light of the sun.  People
make their way through the busy Caemlyn streets further into the city, on
towards the Queen's Highway, where the main bustle of traffic fills the
streets.

The Tar Valon Gate~
To the east and west, two large towers frame the Tar Valon Gate of
Caemlyn.  The guards stationed here glance at every traveller, noble and
commoner alike, before dismissing them as harmless.  The cobbled road has
been worn smooth from decades of travellers and guardsmen passing these
gates.  To the north, the cobbled road fades into a beaten dirt road, fading
from view in the Braem Wood.  Far beyond Braem, the Dragonmount and White
Tower of Tar Valon pierce the horizon like daggers towards the heavens. 
South of these gates lies Caemlyn, the capitol of Andor.  The Main Street
leads south into the bustle of the New City.  A poster has been tacked to
one of the guardhouse doors.

The Tar Valon Gate Guardtower~
This Andoran guardhouse is one of the many posts around Caemlyn
maintained by the Queen's Guard.  Manned at all times, it provides a certain
amount of safety for those inside the walls.  The guards must slip somewhere
else in the city for rest; there are no beds to be seen.  Leading upwards, a
ladder reaches to the top of the tower where guards are stationed, while
east leads to the Tar Valon Gate.  The heavily mortared seams of the thick
stonework would suggest these walls might even survive a second Breaking.

Atop this guard tower, one can see the Tar Valon Gate and the stretch of
Braem Wood that leads from Andor to Tar Valon.  Far beyond Braem, the
Dragonmount and White Tower pierce the horizon like daggers towards the
heavens.  A wall of cut stone rises to the waist, giving adequate safety
from accidentally falling over the side.  The floor is of the same stone as
the wall, dull grey and course, yet strong against the forces of nature.  A
ladder leading downwards is the only exit apparent.  The heavily mortared
seams of the thick stonework would suggest these walls might even survive a
second Breaking.

stonework would suggest these walls might even survive a second Breaking.

Atop the Guard Tower~
Atop this guard tower, one can see the Tar Valon Gate and the stretch of
Braem Wood that leads from Andor to Tar Valon.  Far beyond Braem, the
Dragonmount and White Tower pierce the horizon like daggers towards the
heavens.  A wall of cut stone rises to the waist, giving adequate safety
from accidentally falling over the side.  The floor is of the same stone as
the wall, dull grey and course, yet strong against the forces of nature.  A
ladder leading downwards is the only exit apparent.  The heavily mortared
seams of the thick stonework would suggest these walls might even survive a
second Breaking.

Arrow Street~
The long stretch of Arrow Street is the second longest avenue running the
north-south axis of Caemlyn.  The Tar Valon Gate of Caemlyn lies to the
north, after Arrow Street merges with the Lion's Pride Way.  The capital
city of Andor, Caemlyn, stretches out to the south.  Over a landscape of
hills the city was built, its cobblestone roads running a crazy-quilt
pattern along the subtle curves of the terrain.  The further south the roads
progress, the higher the city rises into the air, until it reaches its
pinnacle with the Royal Palace of Andor.  The Royal Palace rests like a
beautiful jewel in the setting of jade and heartstone that is the Palace
grounds and walls.  The cobblestone road also branches off to the east,
aptly called Wall Road East as it follows the New City wall around Caemlyn. 
A large red brick establishment to the south has a grand stable outside it,
to offer an evening's rest or week's lodging to the tired steeds of
travelers.

Wall Road North~
The crazy-quilt layout of Caemlyn's New City has streets stretching off
in all directions.  Following the natural flow of the hills upon which this
city was built, many roads and runs lead between the assortment of buildings
in the city, making it nearly maze-like to traverse.  The Wall Road runs
along the outskirts of the city, a dozen paces from the towering walls
surrounding the New City.  Still, the cobblestone roads flow along the
city's curves, intersected at intervals by streets running deeper within. 
The hills of Caemlyn flow and roll lowly throughout the city, rising higher
to the south where the Royal Palace rests atop the highest, like a
glittering crown against the sun.  The light traffic of the Wall Road North
seems to flow to the west towards the Tar Valon Gate and merges with Arrow
Street, while the cobblestone road leads along the city walls to the south.

Tilaen's Folly~
The normal hubhub of the city quiets some along Tilaen's Folly, which
lends itself to be more of a residential area than the rest of the
commercialized city.  Few shops line this high-hilled road, as most of the
residences are beautiful white plaster with worked wood framing.  Two
intersections find their way at both the eastern and western ends of this
road, the one to the west seeming to lead further into the heart of the
city, while the one to the east leading towards the towering New City walls.
To the north, a thin iron fence wreathed in beautiful flowers surrounds a
large garden.  Within the garden, the statue of a female form looks
expectantly to the east.

heavily trod upon cobblestones of the Arc still seem no worse for wear, no

down one of Caemlyn's many hilly roads, aptly entitled the Wall Road.  A
street to the south shows the parallel Queen's Highway only a few blocks
away, crossing Kellerman Way.

Ishara's Peace~
This is one of the many picturesque gardens that line the white
cobblestone roads of Caemlyn.  A square at least thirty feet in ever
direction, it is lined on all sides by a thinly-wrought iron gating. 
Fleecing the iron, vines twine in and out, casually intermingled with
Maiden's Hope white or the crimson of Loversknot.  The thin hedges that
skirt the garden are interrupted by the white cobblestone walkways that lead
from the benches to the center fountain.  There is a relative sweetness in
the air, and the sounds of everyday bustle are washed away by the flitting
of birds in the grasses and the soft sound of flowing waters from the
fountain.

Outside the Moneylender's~
This large property is dominated by a single, two-story building, built
of beautiful white marble and roofed by a golden dome gleaming brightly in
the sun.  Lush green hedges trim the property, jewelled with the crimson and
white of Loversknot and Maiden's Hope, while a single marble walkway leads
to the building from the Lion's Pride Way to the east.  This property is
decidedly well-kept, with marble benches lining the walk to the building,
and the hedges and grasses clipped precisely.

Junction of Kellerman Way and Wall Road East~
Wall Road East follows the natural curves of the city, running a dozen
paces from the towering walls encircling the New City.  The cobblestone
roads flow along the city's curves, intersected at intervals by streets
running deeper within.  The hills of Caemlyn flow and roll lowly throughout
the city, rising higher to the south where the Royal Palace rests atop the
highest, like a glittering crown against the sun.  Kellerman's Way quickly
arches off to the north here, leading deeper into the center of the city. 
To the west, flowing up one of the New City's highest hills, the Inner City
walls tower in the sky beyond Inner City Circle.

Junction of the Inner City Circle and Wall Road East~
Atop one of the higher hills of Caemlyn lies the Inner City Circle, a
long road that follows the natural curves of the wall that surrounds the
Inner City.  From here, one can look down on the New City of Caemlyn,
predominently to the north.  The New City has a crazy-quilt layout, the
smooth cobblestone streets flowing around the city's hilled landscape. 
Beautiful parks and fountains can be seen throughout the city, amidst the
homes and shops of red brick, grey stone, and white marble.  Here, Inner
City Circle meets with Wall Road East, which follows the curves of Caemlyn's
New City Wall.  Beyond the New City Walls, the beautiful landscape of Andor
stretches out as far as the eye can see, with roads trailing off over each
horizon line.  Wall Road East continues to the east, flowing down from the
highest hill in the New City.

Wall Road East~
Encircling the highest hill within Caemlyn's New City, this stretch of
Wall Road East also serves as part of the Inner City Circle.  The
tightly-fit cobblestone of the road shows no signs of wear, even though it
sees the wear of passing sedan chairs from the lords and ladies entering the
Inner City.  The walls of the New City and the Inner City tower above the
sides of the street, giving the impression of a great marble valley.  Light
shadows fall on this part of the city most all the day, as only a few hours
pass when the sun rises directly overhead, filling the valley with direct
light.  The lively bustle of the city lies downhill to the north, where Wall
Road East blends with the residential district of Caemlyn.  To the south, a
large gate allows entrance to the Inner City, set within the silver-streaked
walls.

Inner City Circle~
Inner City Circle and Wall Road East break from eachother to the north,
with this aspect trailing the inside walls of the Inner City.  Following the
crest of one of the New City's highest hills, Inner City Circle continues on
level, while Wall Road East begind sloping downhill.  The walls of the Inner
City tower gray stone over fifty feet in the air, with washes and streaks of
silver and white.  To the east of Inner City Circle, small, yet prosperous
storefronts line the streetside.  Goods and services of all sorts seem
offered along the inside of this street, within buildings of white marble
and red brick.  Most the doors are open along the block and many of the
shopkeepers actually wait in the doorway and pleasantly greet those who pass
by.  Within the walls of the Inner City, the Royal Palace of Caemlyn can be
seen nestled in its bossom.  Spiralling towers of white marble and dome
gleam within, each flying the banner of Andor proudly from their tops.

Junction of Wall Road South and Palace Way~
The bustle of the city washes over those new to Caemlyn at this
intersection.  Many of the travelers coming from the southern Far Madding
Gate actually stop footsteps before the intersection, gazing in awe upon the
wondrous capital city of Andor.  Palace Way is a tightly-knit cobblestone
street that leads uphill towards the Inner City of Caemlyn.  The Inner City
is built upon one of the highest hills in the New City.  The New City of
Caemlyn is less than two thousand years old, encircling a wall of silver and
white-streaked gray marble stone.  Within those walls lies the Inner City,
proclaimed as beautiful a sight as Tar Valon, and within the Inner City lies
the Royal Palace where the Queen herself resides.  Before the Inner City
lies a great circular plaza, filled with both citizens and visitors.  The
people freely mingle in the plaza as entertainers of all kinds weave their
delights for all to see.  To the east and west, Wall Road slowly begins its
cobblestone ascent up the landscape of Caemlyn, past small gardens and
parks.

Palace Way~
Less than a few hundred feet to the north, up an incline of tightly-knit
cobblestones towards the Palace Way, lies the Inner City of Caemlyn.  The
silver-streaked walls of the Inner City rise fifty paces above the hill upon
which it rests and within them, the Royal Palace rises much higher.  Towers
of spiralling white marble and golden-domed buildings lie beyond the Royal
Palace, infusing the viewer with a feeling of splendor at the city's
magnificence.  Palace Way is lined on the east and west by beautiful
gardens, blossoming with the crimson and white of Loversknot and Maiden's
Hope.  The bustle of the city begins to the north, as Wall Road South
crosses Palace Way.  Caemlyn's citizens go about their merry way, giving
well-wishings to those they pass in a pleasant manner.  Before the walls of
the Inner City lies a great circle, which is filled with entertainers and
people.

The Far Madding Gate~
To the east and west, two large towers frame the Far Madding Gate of
Caemlyn.  The guards stationed here glance at every traveller, noble and
commoner alike, before dismissing them as harmless.  The cobbled road has
been worn smooth from decades of travellers and guardsmen passing these
gates.  To the south, a small village lines the Far Madding Road for a
stretch before fading into the Hills of Kintara.  North of these gates lies
Caemlyn, the capitol Andor.  Gardens and cobblestone roads lead north into
the city, towards the Inner City and the Royal Palace.  A brief stride north
leads to an open square with people in full bustle.  A poster has been
tacked to one of the guardhouse doors.

The Far Madding Gate Guardtower~
This Andoran guardhouse is one of the many posts around Caemlyn
maintained by the Queen's Guard.  Manned at all times, it provides a certain
amount of safety for those inside the walls.  The guards must slip somewhere
else in the city for rest; there are no beds to be seen.  Leading upwards, a
ladder reaches to the top of the tower where guards are stationed, while
west leads to the Far Madding Gate.  The heavily mortared seams of the thick
stonework would suggest these walls might even survive a second Breaking.

Atop this guard tower, one can see the Far Madding Gate and the patches
of farmland that lay beyond it.  The Far Madding Road rolls for miles before
fading from view in the Hills of Kintara.  A wall of cut stone rises to the
waist, giving adequate safety from accidentally falling over the side.  The
floor is of the same stone as the wall, dull grey and course, yet strong
against the forces of nature.  A ladder leading downwards is the only exit
apparent.  The heavily mortared seams of the thick stonework would suggest

Wall Road South~
Wall Road follows the city limits around the towering walls that protect
Caemlyn.  The walls are of a greyish stone- streaked with white and silver. 
The city of Caemlyn is built upon the natural hilled landscape of Andor,
with the Inner City and the Royal Palace nestled on the highest hills.  The
southern end of the city is not the lowest ground in Caemlyn, far to the
north, beyond the cresting of the Inner City, the cobblestone streets dip
into the low-rolling hills of the commercial and residential districts of
the city.  The Inner City is encircled by an avenue that follows along the
crest of the highest hill in the New City.  The Far Madding Gate leading
into Caemlyn lies to the southeast.  From it, a staggered stream of visitors
arrive from the south of the city.  Upon entering Caemlyn they seem awed by
the glory that is Andor's capital city, as many of them stop in their tracks
when their gaze falls upon the Royal Palace.  A large garden with
ivy-wreathed fencing lies to the north.

Junction of Wall Road South, Master's Way and Maiden's Way~
Master's Way and Maiden's Way lead here and converge on Wall Road South. 
Both streets seem to be minor avenues when compared to Wall Road, given the
breadth of passage allowed by the street that follows the city's boundries. 
The cobbleston of Wall Road South easily allows for the passage of two
wagons, with plenty of space for pedestrian traffic as well.  To the north,
Master's Way rises uphill towards the Inner City Circle, where the Inner
City and the city proper of Caemlyn lie.  Following Master's Way on the west
side are trimmed hedge sculptures of fanciful female forms, frolicking and
prancing up the Way towards the gate leading into a park.  Maiden's Way also
climbs uphill to the east towards the Inner City Circle and the plaza before
the southern gates leading into the Inner City.  Wall Road South leads
around the outskirts of the city to the west and towards the Far Madding
Gate to the south.  A sporadic flow of travellers arrive from the southern
gate, all immediately awed by high-rising and beutiful Royal Palace nestled
within the Inner City.

Wall Road South~
In the lower southwest corner of Caemlyn, the city rises to the north and
east over tightly-knit cobblestone streets that follow the natural ascension
of the realm's hilled landscape.  Lining Wall Road South are smaller gardens
set before the walls of the New City.  A larger park lies beyond a thin
posted fence that spirals seamlessly from the marble of the cobblestone. 
Within the park, a wide breadth of lush green grass provides comfort to
those couples who have taken up to canoodling outside.  Couples lounge about
on brightly colored blankets, happily content in their company while eaither
eating, talking or simply staring into eachother's eyes.  Various bushes
splash a rainbow of color about the park and large hedge sculptures help add
a feeling of serenity and romanticism within.  Wall Road South makes its way
towards the Far Madding Gate to the east, where the traffic of visitors to
the city begins to grow.

hedge sculptures help add a feeling of serenity and romanticism within.  At
the north end of the park lies a large fountain, drowning out the sound of
the city's bustle without.

Junction of Inner City Circle and Wall Road West~
The junction of Inner City Circle and Wall Road West lies upon the
highest hill in all of the New City.  The tightly-knit cobblestone street
follows the ridge of the hill, encircling the walls of the Inner City. 
Between the towering walls protecting both the Inner and New Cities there is
a light shade that falls in the gleaming marble canyon.  Only during the
noon hours is the sun so high in the sky overhead that light fills it. 
Within the Inner City's gleaming walls, the natural hilled landscape of
Andor rises higher still, supporting beautiful works of Ogier architecture
and the Royal Palace of Andor.  The city of Caemlyn filters out from here to
the north, cascading down into the lower-rolling hills of the city.  Inner
City Circle curves to the southeast, where a brief walk leads past the Inner
City Plaza and towards the Far Madding Gate.

Wall Road West~
Wall Road follows the walls of Caemlyn's New City around the length of
the hilled landscape upon which the city was built.  Cobblestone streets
follow the crazy-quilt layout of the city, flowing naturally over and
amongst the low-rising hills within the city proper.  To the southeast, Wall
Road West leads uphill towards the Inner City walls, gently inclining up the
highest hill in the New City.  Buildings of red brick and white plaster line
the streets here, most with a view of the Royal Palace within the Inner City
towering over them.  The closer to the Inner City this street gets, the more
of a veritable marble valley it seems, growing tighter between the walls.

Wall Road West~
The loud bustle of the city rises to the north, where Bull's Path leads
into the Lugard Gate of the city.  From there, many visiting hawkers and
peddlers make their way into the city, hoping to find a place to rest their
travel-worn bodies and put up their boots.  Wall Road follows the towering

Junction of Bull's Path and Wall Road West~
The heavy throng of people along Bull's Path pushes towards the west, to
greet the peddlers and merchants fresh from their tradings in Murandy. 
Arriving from the Lugard Gate to the west, many of these merchants are
caught unawares by the greeting they receive from Caemlyn's enthusiastic
citizens.  Here, the city spreads out in all directions by way of
tightly-knit white cobblestone streets.  Through the flood of people west,
the Lugard Gate leads from the city towards Murandy and the southern lands. 
To the north and south, the cobblestone streets make their way along the
walls of the New City.  Set along these walls are beautiful gardens,
backdropped against the silver-streaked white marble walls of the city. 
Storefronts and inns line Bull's Path towards the east, welcoming the
individual visitor to the city and offering a quiet respite from the long
travel.  As the street rises to the east, the Royal Palace can be seen
resting atop Caemlyn's highest peak, nestled in the bossom of the Inner
City.

Bull's Path~
Thr throng of Caemlyn's citizens fills the streets here, as the people
are overly eager to view the wares of the peddlers travelling from Murandy. 
The tightly-knit cobblestone of Bull's Path resounds and echoes with the
footfalls of both man and horse alike, mixing with the cries of the citizens
to create a defeaning thunder this close to the Lugard Gate.  The large gate
to the west is flanked on the north and south by twin towers of white
marble.  Guardsmen aside the gate grin and smile as the peddlers flow
through the gate, unaware to the welcome that awaits those coming into
Caemlyn for the first time.  The city spreads out to the east, Wall Road
West branching off to the north and south, while Bull's Path leads towards
the Royal Palace and Inner City to the east.  The beauty of Caemlyn is the
way the architecture of the city rolls and flows over the hilled landscape,
cobblestone streets slowly rising and falling before reaching their pinnacle
at the Royal Palace.  It rests upon the highest hill, a glittering jewel
nestled in the bossom of the Inner City.

The Lugard Gate~
To the north and south, two large towers frame the Lugard Gate of
Caemlyn.  The guards stationed here glance at every traveller, noble and
commoner alike, before dismissing them as harmless.  The cobbled road has
been worn smooth from decades of travellers and guardsmen passing these
gates.  To the west, the cobbled road continues on before ending at a
pavillion and fountain.  Beyond the pavillion, a hard-packed earthen road
makes its way to the southwest towards the city of Lugard in Murandy.  East
of these gates lies Caemlyn, the capitol of Andor.  Bull's Path begins here,
leading straight towards the Inner City gates of Caemlyn.  Within, rising
atop the highest hill of the city lies the Royal Palace.  A poster has been
tacked to one of the guardhouse doors.  To the east, Bull's Path is packed
with people waiting to assault peddlers from Murandy, while the peddlers try
to make their way into the city and find a place to rest their wearied feet.

The Lugard Gate Gatehouse~
This Andoran guardhouse is one of the many posts around Caemlyn
maintained by the Queen's Guard.  Manned at all times, it provides a certain
amount of safety for those inside the walls.  The guards must slip somewhere
else in the city for rest; there are no beds to be seen.  Leading upwards, a
ladder reaches to the top of the tower where guards are stationed, while
south leads to the Lugard Gate.  The heavily mortared seams of the thick
stonework would suggest that even these walls may survive a second breaking.

Atop the Guard Tower~
Atop this guard tower, one can see the Lugard Gate and the patches of
farmland that lay beyond it.  A wall of cut stone rises to the waist, giving
adequate safety from accidentally falling over the side.  The floor is of
the same stone as the wall, dull grey and course, yet strong against the
forces of nature.  A ladder leading downwards is the only exit apparent.

Bull's Path~
The rich scent of hickory flows freely from the inn to the north.  Baring
a wood-burned sign with a mishapened bull, the inn proudly proclaims itself
'The Longhorn Inn'.  A three-story building built of rich red brick, from
within can be heard the jovial boasts and stories told by travelling
merchants over a good meal.  The inn seems a popular place for those new to
the city, travelling from the south.  Outside, a young boy is busy watching
over the steeds of travellers within the inn.  Bull's Path flows downhill to
the west towards the Lugard Gate.  The cobblestone of the street rises
uphill to the east, gentling making it's way towards the Inner City Gates
and the Royal Palace within.  Several streets intersect Bull's Path before
reaching the gates, making the walk a careful one with the traffic of the
area.

Wall Road West~
The crazy-quilt layout of Caemlyn's New City has streets stretching off
in all directions.  Following the natural flow of the hills upon which this
city was built, many roads and runs lead between the assortment of buildings
in the city, making it nearly maze-like to traverse.  The Wall Road runs
along the outskirts of the city, a dozen paces from the towering walls
surrounding the New City.  Still, the cobblestone roads flow along the
city's curves, intersected at intervals by streets running deeper within. 
The hills of Caemlyn flow and roll lowly throughout the city, rising higher
to the east where the Royal Palace rests atop the highest, like a glittering
crown against the sun.  To the north, Rampant Lane rolls uphill to the east,
leading further into the city.  The loud bustle of the city rises to the
south, where Bull's Path leads into the Lugard Gate of the city.  From
there, many visiting hawkers and peddlers make their way into the city,
hoping to find a place to put up their boots for the evening before selling
their wares in the morning.

of beautiful white marble, with fanciful reliefs and columns decorating
them.  The flowers and banners that hang outside the homes all reflect honor
upon the Queen and Andor, vibrant crimson and white washing over the street.
Still, as glorious as Kenabru Walk is, it is one of the shortest streets of
the city.

The crazy-quilt layout of Caemlyn's New City has streets stretching off
in all directions.  Following the natural flow of the hills upon which this
city was built, many roads and runs lead between the assortment of buildings
in the city, making it nearly maze-like to traverse.  The Wall Road runs
along the outskirts of the city, a dozen paces from the towering walls
surrounding the New City.  Still, the cobblestone roads flow along the
city's curves, intersected at intervals by streets running deeper within. 
The hills of Caemlyn flow and roll lowly throughout the city, rising higher
to the south where the Royal Palace rests atop the highest, like a
glittering crown against the sun.  To the north, the bustle of the city
rises to a fervored pitch as the sounds of Caemlyn's citizens mix with
hawkers and visitors from other nations.

West Hill Rise~
The bustle of the Queen's Highway roars to the north.  Both citizens and
visitors to the city can be seen milling about the streets, heading both to
and fro the western Whitebridge Gate.  West Hill Rise begins south of the
Queen's Highway, steadily climbing the further south it travels.  To the
north, West Hill Rise descends into the Queen's Highway and into the chaos
of the main boulevard of the city.  Directly south, Kenabru Walk intersects
with West Hill Rise, its wondrous white marble buildings and architecture
renowned for their splendor in the New City.  The ascent of the cobblestone
street ends a few hundred feet to the south, nearly rising to the heights of
the Inner City Circle.  Towering walls of silver-streaked white marble
encircle the Inner City there, with the Royal Palace nestled deeply within-
atop the highest hill in all the countryside.

Junction West Hill Rise and Kenabru Walk~
Thee homes and buildings along Kenabru walk are perhaps the most
beautiful in all of the New City.  White marble structures almost seem to
rise from the cobblestone of the street, with fanciful images sculpted in
both relief and statues outside the buildings.  A large building of white
marble to the east appears to be a museum of sorts, with two dozen steps
leading up to its doors.  West Hill Rise runs from the northern Queen's
Highway south towards Bull's Path.  A number of lesser streets intersect
with West Hill Rise, as it steadily climbs the hilled landscape of the city.
Tightly-knit white cobblestone ascends the further south one goes, leading
up towards the Inner City Circle, which crests the highest hill in the New
City.

West Hill Rise~
Beautiful white marble buildings line the cobblestone streets of the
intersection to the north.  Known as one of the most beautiful streets in
the New City, Kenabru Walk is also one of the shortest.  West Hill Rise
steadily ascends to the south, rising over the natural hilled landscape of
the city.  Many streets intersect it, as Kenabru Walk to the north and
Fletching Way to the south, so there is a fair amount of traffic despite its
ascent.  The buildings south of the Kenabru Walk intersection all seem to be
of white marble and grayish stone, few with domed roofs but most with red or
purple tiles.  West Hill Rise begins at the northern Queen's Highway and
ends at Bull's Path, just short of the Inner City Circle.  The Inner City
lies atop the highest hill in Caemlyn's New City, and within can be seen
buildings that pale the architecture of the New City in size and beauty. 
Rising upon the highest hill of the Inner City is the Royal Palace, where
all the gleaming marble streets within seem to ascend to.

Junction of Rampant Lane and Needle Street~
The citizens of Caemlyn mix with the capital's visitors here at this
intersection.  In this quarter of the city, the buildings that line the
roads are of various types.  Some are homes, some shoppes and others inns. 
Buildings of white marble or gray-washed stone seem predominent, with roofs
that are domed or tiled in purple or red.  Needle Street runs from the
southern Bull's Path to the Queen's Highway, north.  Rolling downhill to the
north, Needle Street passes by many buildings, most homes that rise to a
second-story.  Amidst these buildings, a run leads to the west towards a
small park nestled amongst the homes.  Rampant Lane runs from the center of
the New City to the west and ends at the Wall Road.

West Hill Rise~
This stretch of West Hill Rise lies between two intersections.  To the
north it crosses Fletching Way while to the south it intersects with Rampant
Lane.  Along the streets and intersections, buildings of white plaster and
gray-washed stone rise as high as two-stories, with roofs of tiled purple
and red.  The closer one travels to the Inner City, rising upon the highest
hill of the New City to the south, the more elaborate and fanciful the
buildings seem to be designed.  The majority of the buildings here are
homes, shoppes and small inns, judging by the friendly flow of traffic that
that fills the streets.  Queen's Guardsmen make their way amongst the
citizens of Caemlyn, offering greetings and salutation, while peering inside
the smaller shoppes and inns to make sure all is well.

Junction of West Hill Rise and Fletching Way~
At this intersection, West Hill Rise and Fletching Way meet at a terraced
incline.  Ascending at a steady angle, West Hill Rise climbs one of the many
hills of the city of Caemlyn.  The cobblestone of the intersection is
tightly-knit and well swept, with no debris to be seen anywhere.  The climb
reaches southward towards the Inner City, the glory of Caemlyn, and descends
to the north towards the Queen's Highway, the largest boulevard in the city.
Crossing West Hill Rise is Fletching Way.  One of the first roads built
south of the Queen's Highway, Fletching Way was named briefly after Arrow
Street.  Fletching Way crosses Arrow Street, far to the east, to the east
and west, acting like the namesake feathering of an arrow.  As it crosses
West Hill Rise, it is terraced off to allow level passage for those crossing
it.  The crazy-quilt layout of the city was designed to flow evenly between
the many hills and buildings of Caemlyn, while offering easy passage when
possible.  The buildings surrounding this intersection seem crafted of white
marble or gray-washed stone and the people frequent them amiably going about
their daily routine.

West Hill Rise~
Shoppes, homes and small inns make up this district of Caemlyn.  The
streets run between the buildings following the natural hilled landscape of
the city.  Most of the buildings are made of white marble or gray-washed
stone, with tiled roofs of purple and red.  West Hill Rise runs from north
to south, from the Queen's Highway towards Bull's Path.  The street has a
steady rise to it, the cobblestone running over one of the more pronounced
hills in the city.  Over the buildings on the west side of the road, the
walls of Caemlyn's New City can be seen close by, while to the east the city
spreads itself out in the residential and merchant districts.

Junction of Bull's Path, West Hill Rise and Low Rise Terrace~
Given the hilled landscape upon which Caemlyn was built, often times
Ogier craftsmanship was called upon to terrace off the hills in order to
create a more levelled cityscape for ease of travel.  Three roads intersect
here, making this junction one of the more heavily travelled this close to
the Lugard Gate.  Running from the north and curving to the southeast, West
Hill Rise quickly follows the natural hilled landscape and rolls towards the
Inner City Circle.  Beautiful white cobblestones nestle tightly in a pattern
in the streets, flowing between the small shoppes and homes that surround
the Inner City.  Branching off from West Hill Rise is Low Rise Terrace, a
street that forks off in a more southernly direction with a slighter incline
towards the Inner City.  Lining the eastern side of Low Rise Terrace is a
long row of beautiful, terraced-off gardens across from many of Caemlyn's
nicer white marble homes.  The wide stretch of Bull's Path makes its way
through the bustle of newly-arriving merchants and peddler from the western
Lugard Gate towards the Inner City Gates to the east.  Storefronts and inns
line the streets here, with people making their busy ways within and out. 
The beauty of the city spreads out to the north and east, beckoning the
weary traveller deeper within.

Junction of Pearman's Lane and Needle Street~
Arching streets curve from the north and south joining here.  Needle
Street follows the slope of one of the many hills Caemlyn was built upon. 
It slowly rises, heading from the Queen's Highway to the northeast to the
southwest.  Pearman's Lane takes a more direct route towards the Inner City,
a brisk climb of a thin avenue heading from the northwest to the southeast. 
The hills and streets of Caemlyn rise higher the further one travels to the
south, ending in the glory of Caemlyn- the Inner City and the Royal Palace
within.  Lying atop the highest of the city's hills, the Inner City is a
remarkable work of Ogier craftsmanship.  The wall surrounding it and the
buildings within nearly gleam and sparkle when reflecting the light of the
midday sun.  Through a gate to the north lies one of the many parks and
fountains that decorate the beautiful city.  With an open expanse of
courtyard, gardens and a fountain bring a breath of life to the square to
the north.

Needle Street~
Needle Street slowly begins its rise from the Queen's Highway north to
the southwest, as it makes its way up and around one of the many hills
created by Andor's landscape.  Just south of the Queen's Highway, the
thunder of Caemlyn's central avenue resonates through the wide street. 
Meandering over the natural hills of the city, Needle Street is marked by
inns and taverns mixed among tailors, grocers and every sort of shoppe one
would expect to find in a capital city.  All save an actual needlemaker. 
Where once this street had been filled with the delicate craft, it is now
lost here, leaving only a sad irony.  The tightly-knit cobblestone runs past
red brick and gray-washed buildings to the east.  Within a large fenced-off
garden to the west, a white marble fountain streams water into the sky from
a white marble basin.

Fletching Way~
The tightly-knit cobblestone of this street is lined to the north by
fencing of wrought iron surrounding a brilliant garden.  Within the garden,
blossoms of all kinds bloom within, but all are a bright ivory or white. 
One of the first roads built south of the Queen's Highway, Fletching Way was
named briefly after Arrow Street.  Fletching Way crosses Arrow Street to the
east and west, acting like the namesake feathering of an arrow.  A building
of gray stone lies to the south at two stories.  Judging by the sounds of
laughing and music from within, "The Blackthorn's Delight" seems to be an
inn or tavern.  Far to the south, atop the highest hill of Caemlyn's New
City, the Inner City is encircled by a wall of silver-streaked stone. 
Within, glorious buildings of Ogier-craftsmanship spiral high into the sky,
rivalling the beauty of even Tar Valon.  Nestled deep within the Inner City,
the Royal Palace lies atop the highest hill in the countryside, the pinnacle
of Andor in both beauty and pride.

Rolling downhill from west to east, Rampant Lane follows the natural

tightly fit cobblestone offers a firm foundation for the people who tread
over it.  Rampant Lane runs from the center of the New City to the west and
ends at the Wall Road.  Along the street, homes and plentiful establishments
line the way.  Their exteriors of white marble or marbled gray stone.  This
close to the Inner City, the homes and buildings are fancifully decorated,
with various reliefs in the walls and flower gardens aside the street.  To
the west, Rampant Lane intersects with West Hill Rise, leading to the
northern quarters of the city.

lean out their shops, calling out to eachother and those who pass why,
offering well-wishings or special prices to attract attention.  While it in
no way compares with the throng of the Queen's Highway, Needle Street sees
its share of the city's coin.

Fletching Way~
Running from the east to west, Fletching Way was named briefly after the
building of Arrow Street, lying to the eastern end of the city.  Between the
junctions of West Hill Rise to the west and Laendar Arc to the east, the
buildings on this span of Fletching Way seem mostly built of white marble or
gray-washed stone.  Many rise only a single story, but few rise to two.  The
main traffic and bustle of Caemlyn seems to lie to the north, as the city
slowly rolls overhill the farther north one progresses.  The Queen's Highway
is alive with the citizens of the city and hawkers, stretching from the west
gate to the east.  To the south, rising as a pinnacle of glory and
accomplishment, the Royal Palace lies nestled in the gleaming walls of the
Inner City- atop the highest hill in all of Caemlyn.  The cobblestone of
Fletching Way lies terraced off to the west as West Hill Rise climbs one of
the sloping hills of the city.

Junction of Fletching Way and Pearman's Lane~
Tightly-knit cobblestone leads the way between the buildings here of red
brick and gray-washed stone.  A handful of fruit sellers still maintain
their shops from generations past, even though outside vendors along the
Queen's Highway have cut sharply into their sales.  Many of these
shopkeepers have had their lives passed down from generation to generation,
from the days of the first Queen Ishara.  Pearman's Lane runs from the
Queen's Highway to Rampant Lane, merging with Lion's Pride Way to lead up
the hilled landscape to the Inner City Circle.  Even from here, where the
lane intersects with Fletching Way, the magnificence of the Inner City and
the Royal Palace can be seen.  The traffic on Drayla's Court is mostly
pedestrian, while sedan chairs and wagons can be seen to the east making
their way down Lion's Pride.  The citizens of Caemlyn and the Queen's Guard
offer well-wishings and begin idle conversation with both eachother and
visitors to the city.  From ever few buildings, banners hang from the
second-story depicting the Rampant Lion of Andor both white on crimson and
crimson on white.

Rampant Lane~
Rolling downhill from west to east, Rampant Lane follows the natural
curves of the city of Caemlyn.  Like many of the streets of the city,
tightly fit cobblestone offers a firm foundation for the people who tread
over it.  Rampant Lane runs from the center of the New City to the west and
ends at the Wall Road.  Along the street, homes and plentiful establishments
line the way.  Their exteriors of white marble or marbled gray stone.  This
close to the Inner City, the homes and buildings are fancifully decorated,
with various reliefs in the walls and flower gardens aside the street. 
Rampant Lane opens into an intersection with Lion's Pride Way to the east. 
The busy street is alive with people heading towards the Inner City and the
Queen's Highway.

Junction of Fletching Way and Needle Street~
This intersection sees little traffic given the severity of its climb to
the south.  The cobblestones of the street are tightly-knit and resounds
harsh underneath the fall of boot or horse shoe.  Given its proximity to the
Inner City, the incline of the street makes it one of the more difficult
ones to traverse when heading south on Needle Street.  Fletching Way runs
from the east to the west, making its way through the intersection on a
level, terraced-off platform.  The architecture of the buildings surrounding
this intersection is of white marble and gray-washed stone, while the city
to the north is dotted with homes of red brick.  A few hundred paces to the
east, Lion's Pride Way can be seen as it makes its way towards the Inner
City of Caemlyn and the Royal Palace within.  The white marble buildings and
majesty within is the cause for much of the awe and wonder that surrounds
Andor's capitol.

Lion's Pride Way~
The Lion's Pride Way is the long road stretching between the Tar Valon
Gate and the Royal Palace.  It is the second longest road in all of Caemlyn,
being surpassed only by the Queen's Highway, though it is easily the most
colorful and well-decorated road.  The beautiful cobblestone road leads deep
into the city, and is hedged the whole way by small gardems laced with the
crimsom and white of Loversknot and Maiden's Hope.  The busy streets bustle
with life, as hawkers mill about, shouting, screaming, and peddling their
wares from the walkways, while sedan chairs are drawn with lords and ladies
throughout the city.  Buildings of differing architecture, from red brick to
white plaster follows the Pride along the west, the billowing banners
depicting the Lion of Andor flagrantly hang from the windows.  The Queen's
Highway roars with life and activity to the north, making the usual pitch of
the city seem a dull whisper.  To the south, the beautiful cobblestone
streets begin to rise their way up the country's subtle hills, leading
towards the Inner City and the Royal Palace.

Junction of Lion's Pride and Fletching Way~
The intersection of Fletching Way and Lion's Pride Way is alive with the
sounds of the busy city.  People laugh and jest on their way to their
separate destinations, offering greetings and well-wishings to those they
pass.  The great walls of the Inner City rise to the south at the end of
Lion's Pride Way, meeting at one of the three gates leading in.  A crowd of
people have gathered there, speaking with the Queen's Guard guarding the
gate.  From within the Inner City walls, towering spires of Ogier-crafted
marble and beautiful domed buildings shine.  Atop the highest hill in the
city, deep within the Inner City, the Royal Palace of Caemlyn resides like a
glittering jewel.  Gleaming cobblestone roads twine around the hills of the
city, all making their way to the beautiful palace.  Fletching Way runs east
and west through the city, connecting Lion's Pride and Arrow Street.

bit less traffic; many of the shopkeepers along it standing outside their
shops, talking amongst themselves.

Fletching Way~
One of the first roads built south of the Queen's Highway, Fletching Way
was named briefly after Arrow Street.  Fletching Way crosses Arrow Street to
the east and west, acting like the namesake feathering of an arrow.  The
bustle of the Lion's Pride Way echoes to the west as the cobblestone street
rises up one of the many hills of the city in that direction.  People can be
seen going about their daily routine, as commoners and lords each give room
to pass for the lacquered sedan chairs that are drawn up and down the
streets.  The buildings and homes along Fletching Way are all crafted of
grey stone or white plaster, with few buildings crafted from marble
intermingled amongst them.  The city of Caemlyn is a built on a series of
ever-rising hills and the streets flow evenly between and over these hills. 
Within the Inner City that rises far to the south, the Royal Palace lies
atop the highest hill of the walled city.  It rests atop the hill like a
glittering jewel, surrounded by the silver-streaked walls of the Inner City.

Junction of Fletching Way and Arrow Street~
Towards the center of Caemlyn, the city thunders with life.  To the
north, the Merchant Square is packed with people.  There, the traffic of the
city has come to a halt, as not to endanger the citizens busy shopping or
traversing their way throughout the city.  Arrow Street leads in a north to
south direction, from the Inner City Circle to the Tar Valon Gate- Caemlyn's
northernmost point.  Here, the residential district blurs with the market
district, as buildings of every type rise from the cobblestone street. 
Quartering off the buildings of red brick, white plaster, and grey stone,
Fletching Way leads off to the east and west.  Homes mingle with shoppes and
stores, as the traffic from the north filters in.

Arrow Street~
The smooth cobblestone of Arrow Street runs from the southern Inner City
Circle, all the way north towards the Tar Valon Gate.  A few dozen paces to
the north, the roar and thunder of the Queen's Highway echoes from the halt
of traffic at the Merchant's Square.  Here, the residential and commercial
districts blur, as a large white plaster home lies to the west, while the
sounds of merriment and entertainment come from a large red brick inn to the
east.  To the south, past the Inner City Circle, the great walls of the
Inner City rise high into the air, their silver-streaked stone seeming a
marble pillow for the pristine Royal Palace lying hundreds of feet within
their depths.

As it's namesake, Rampant Lane begins here, quickly rolling downhill to
the west.  The smooth cobblestones of the street flow perfectly between the
buildings on either side of it, following the city's natural curves and
landscape.  Arrow Street continues to the north and south, through the
center of Caemlyn.  The street runs from the northern Tar Valon Gate to the
Inner City Circle, just a dozen paces to the south.  Across from the
beginnings of Rampant Lane, a single home of gray stone lies to the east. 
Between it and another home, one of Caemlyn's runs leads towards a beautiful
garden centered amongst several homes.  Beyond the Inner City Circle to the
south, the Royal Palace can see upon Caemlyn's highest hill.

City lies to the north, with gates leaving from Caemlyn far to the north,
east, and west.  A central street running throughout the city is the Queen's
Highway, running east to west, and it is teeming with people.  To the west
along the Circle, a gate leads in to the Inner City.  Arrow Street leads
down from here to the north, running through the center of the New City

street with purpose.  Small gardens line the cobblestone of the Lion's
Pride, setting off the Way with Andor's colors of crimson Loversknot and
white Maiden's Hope.  Lion's Pride Way leads down into the city to the north
and stretches to the farthest northern city wall, by the Tar Valon Gate.

The Origan Gate of the Inner City~
Set in the middle of the silver-streaked walls that surround the Inner
City, the Origan Gate is a magnificent arch of pristine white marble.  The
gleaming arch is wide enough to allow two wagons passage at a time, with
ample room for the steady flow of pedestrians to pass as well.  The hills of
the Inner City rise higher than the one upon which Inner City Circle is
built, with the broad paved streets carefully designed to follow the curves
leading up towards the Royal Palace.  Within the Inner City, Ogier
craftsmanship at it's finest has thin gleaming towers of white marble
spiralling hundreds of feet into the sky.  Golden domes glitter in the
sunlight, casting off brilliant reflections about the city.  To the south,
built upon the highest hill in the city, the Royal Palace lies nestled
within her walls, serving as law and inspiration of the land.

Junction of Bull's Path and Laendar Arc~
The hardened white marble cobblestones of this street are tightly knit. 
Leading to the east and west, Bull's Path is an avenue wide enough to
support two wagons with generous girth for pedestrians as well.  As Bull's
Path opens to the east, Caemlyn's citizens flow through this junction
towards the Lugard Gate west, from Laendar Arc to the north and the upwards
incline of the Inner City Circle to the east.  The streets roll up and
around the natural hills of Andor's landscape, making the inclined streets a
more interesting stroll than most cities.  The storefronts and homes along
Bull's Path are mainly of white marble and gray stone, blending with the
benches and walkways along the streets.  Vibrant crimson and white banners
depicting the rampant Lion of Andor hang from the second story of many of
the buildings, giving glory unto Her Majesty, the Queen.  Wrapped in
silver-streaked white marble walls, the Inner City was built by the Ogier
and is home to much of Caemlyn's finer architecture.  Nestled in the bossom
of the Inner City, the Royal Palace rises like a sparkling jewel set against
the shining sun.

naturally follows the curves of the city's hilled landscape.  Needle Street
is marked by inns and taverns mixed among tailors, grocers and every sort of
shoppe one would expect to find in a capital city.  All save an actual
needlemaker.  Where once this street had been filled with the delicate
craft, it is now lost here, leaving only a sad irony.  Many of the craftsmen
lean out their shops, calling out to eachother and those who pass why,
offering well-wishings or special prices to attract attention.  While it in
no way compares with the throng of the Queen's Highway, Needle Street sees
its share of the city's coin.

The hardened white marble cobblestones of this street are tightly knit. 
Leading to the east and west, Bull's Path is an avenue wide enough to
support two wagons with generous girth for pedestrians as well.  Directly to
the west, Bull's Path is alive with the bustle of Caemlyn's citizens mixing
with the peddlers and merchants travelling from Murandy.  Merchants attempt
to work their way into the city for some small respite from their long
travels, only to be mobbed by the people of Caemlyn expecting goods from
far-off lands.  The storefronts and homes along Bull's Path are mainly of
white marble and gray stone, blending with the benches and walkways along
the streets.  Vibrant crimson and white banners depicting the rampant Lion
of Andor hang from the second story of many of the buildings, giving glory

wall of silver-streaked white marble to the north.  The roads eventually
converge on Inner City Circle to the east.  Low Rise Terrace slowly climbs
up towards the east, giving the stroll towards the Inner City a more
pleasant feel to it.  The terrace to the north is decorated by a lavish
garden, filled with vibrant Emond's Glory, heartsblush and jumpup, laced
with ivy.  A smallish square building to the west is relatively unadorned
except for a few light-catchers in the windows.  The door is slightly ajar
and the sound of music can be heard from within.

Inner City Circle~
Encircling the walls of the Inner City, Inner City Circle is one of the
more stable streets in all of Caemlyn.  Running along the ridge of one of
the highest hills in the New City, all streets save those leading into the
Inner City flow downhill into the rest of Caemlyn.  The walls of the Inner
City rise about fifty feet in height and are crafted of an almost
luminescent silver-streaked gray marble.  Below, the New City of Caemlyn is
a crazy-quilt design of red brick, gray stone and white marble buildings. 
Streets curve in and out of the low-rising hills the city was built upon,
giving it an almost hypnotic quality.  The New City spreads out to the west
and north, with several gates leading to the countryside beyond Caemlyn's
walls.  Looking over the outer walls of the city, packed-earth roads lead
off into the horizon, making their way past small shanties built outside
Caemlyn.

The street has a greater incline than most avenues rising towards the Inner
City, being terraced off to the west side and lined with beautiful gardens.

downhill to the northwest here.  The incline towards Bull's Path is not as
severe as most streets leading up to the Inner City Circle, so Low Terrace
Rise is terraced on the eastern side into one of the higher hills of
Caemlyn.

Inner City Circle~
The walls of the New City begin to curve in at this point, midway through
the city of Caemlyn.  The towering New City Wall and Inner City Wall create
a veritable canyon of white marble in which the city is lost, down below. 
Inner City Circle follows the ridge of the highest hill in the New City,
encircling the Inner City Walls and the higher grounds within.  The New City
of Caemlyn filters through the two encroaching walls to the northwest, with
pedestrian traffic heading deeper within the city north.  The sun glitters
and gleams off the golden domes and white marble towers within the Inner
City, giving the Royal Palace within a divine glow about it.  It is only at
mid-day that the grounds below receive a degree of sunlight, as often the
city's walls cast it in shade.

Junction of Inner City Circle and Wall Road West~
The junction of Inner City Circle and Wall Road West lies upon the
highest hill in all of the New City.  The tightly-knit cobblestone street
follows the ridge of the hill, encircling the walls of the Inner City. 
Between the towering walls protecting both the Inner and New Cities there is
a light shade that falls in the gleaming marble canyon.  Only during the
noon hours is the sun so high in the sky overhead that light fills it. 
Within the Inner City's gleaming walls, the natural hilled landscape of
Andor rises higher still, supporting beautiful works of Ogier architecture
and the Royal Palace of Andor.  The city of Caemlyn filters out from here to
the north, cascading down into the lower-rolling hills of the city.  Inner
City Circle curves to the southeast, where a brief walk leads past the Inner
City Plaza and towards the Far Madding Gate.

Junction of Inner City Circle and Master's Way~
Branching off from the Inner City Circle to the south is an elegantly
kept walkway flanked on both sides by beautiful gardens.  Blossoming
prickerthorn bushes have been pruned into the shapes of female figures
dancing and running along the street, racing downhill towards the
lower-rolling grounds.  The cobblestone of Inner City Circle is the most
tightly-knit and well-kept of all within the New City.  As one of the city's
most level roads, it follows the ridgeline of one of the highest hills in
the New City, encircling the higher-rising grounds within the Inner City. 
The walls of the Inner City glitter and gleam with silver-streaked marble
towering over fifty paces high.  Beyond the walls, the Royal Palace of can
be seen nestled within, a glittering gem against the backdrop of the Inner
City.  The Circle curves to the east, towards the southern end of the city
and the Far Madding Gate.  To the north, through a wide canyone of marble
between the city's two predominent walls, the city proper of Caemlyn opens
wide.

Inner City Circle~
From the highest hill in the New City, the cobblestone streets of Caemlyn
flow downhill into the low-rolling hills of the city.  Inner City Circle
follows the crest of this hill, which encircles the silver-streaked white
marble walls of the Inner City.  This being one of the most level roads in
the city, it curves to the southeast towards the Plaza before the South Gate
into the Inner City.  Far to the southeast, the Far Madding Gate sees a slow
flow of traffic coming from those travelling from the southlands.  Most are
dazzled by the immediate view of the Royal Place, nestled high in the bossom
of the Inner City and take a few minutes to awe in its splendor.  A small
park lies to the south, with many children running up and down its slopes,
playing.

Junction of the Inner City Circle and Maiden's Way~
Inner City Circle follows the ridge of one of the highest hills in
Caemlyn's New City.  From here, the city flows downhill and to the west a
tightly-knit cobblestone street leads towards a large park.  Maiden's Way is
lined on the sides of the walk with smaller gardens, blossoming vibrant
colors of all kinds in their growth.  To the east, a plaza opens up before
the South Gate of the Inner City, leading within to the north.  The Inner
City is surrounded by silver-streaked walls of white marble, rising over
fifty feet into the sky.  Atop each of the towers spaced every few hundred
feet within the walls, banners depicting Andor's Rampant Lion in white on a
field of crimson blow proudly in the wind.

Master's Way~
A narrow lane of tightly-knit cobblestone leads uphill towards the Inner
City Circle to the north.  Trailed on both sides by large parks and gardens,
Master's Way seems less frequented than the other streets in the city.  The
little traffic that travels along this lane seems predominently that of
couples, young and old.  Hedge sculptures of prickerthorn depict female
figures prancing and frolicking uphill towards the entrance of the western
park.  Within the park, a wide breadth of lush green grass provides comfort
to those couples who have taken up to canoodling outside.  Couples lounge
about on brightly colored blankets, happily content in their company while
eaither eating, talking or simply staring into eachother's eyes.  Various
bushes splash a rainbow of color about the park and large hedge sculptures
help add a feeling of serenity and romanticism within.  Encircling the park
is a thin posted fence that spirals up from the cobblestone of the road. 
Master's Way flows down the slope of the city towards the south, where it
meets with Wall Road South.

Inner City Circle~
The city of Caemlyn rolls downhill to the south here, leading inevitably
towards the Far Madding Gate.  Tightly-knit cobblestones make up the street
that follows the ridge of the highest hill in Caemlyn's New City, the Inner
City Circle.  From the large plaza to the east, the people of Caemlyn come
away laughing and talking about the day's entertainments with eachother.  As
they walk, they offer greetings to those they pass and respect towards any
of the Queen's Guard they might meet.  The plaza east is a bustle of people
traying to gain entrance into the Inner City and enjoying the entertainers
that often flock there to put on a show.  Gardens and parks lining the
streets of Caemlyn to the south follow the contour of the city's natural
hilled landscape, creating a lush carpet for those within the relax upon.

Inner City Plaza~
A large, circular plaza opens wide before the South Gate of Caemlyn's
Inner City.  To the north, the gates of the Inner City and the towers and
palaces within reach to awe-inspiring heights, gleaming brightly in the noon
sun.  Here, wonder and amazement befall all in Inner City Plaza.  While the
backdrop of the Inner City and all within provide the setting, the Plaza
itself is the stage as entertainers from this city and others drown
themselves in the adulation and applause of the spectators.  The Plaza is
filled with people enjoying the day's entertainments and visitors to the
city enjoy the merriment after their travels.  Inner City Circle spreads out
to the east and west, encircling the walls of the Inner City.  As it is
built upon the crest of one of Caemlyn's highest hills, it is one of the
more level streets in the city.  From here, all roads flow downhill towards
the low-rolling hilled landscape of the city.

Palace Way~
Palace Way runs a short distance up the hill upon which the Inner City
lies.  To the north, a great circle opens before the gates leading into the
Inner City.  The circle is alive with Caemlyn's citizens milling about in
social discourse with eachother and watching the entertainers putting on
their shows.  In the circle, the Queen's Guard watch over people with an
amused smile, happily watching the citizens go about their daily business. 
Palace Way washes the traveller over with glory to the Queen, as gardens
blossom the crimson and white of Andor with Loversknot and Maiden's Hope.  A
grand garden in a raised flower bed divides the Way into twin streets,
almost flowing seamlessly from the tightly knit cobblestone of the Way. 
Flanking the steets on both sides are other gardens, depicting the rampant
Lion of Andor in Maiden's Hope against a field of Loversknot.  To the south,
Wall Road South intersects Palace Way before leading to the Far Madding
Gate.  A large fountain in the shape of a lion lies in the center of the
intersection.

Inner City Circle~
Opening wide before the South Gate of the Inner City to the west is a
wide plaza.  Like Inner City Circle, the plaza is built upon the crest of
one off Caemlyn's highest hills in the New City and is probably the most
level ground in the city to tred.  Inner City Circle stretches the entire
length around the walls of the Inner City, their silver-washed gray stone
towering over fifty feet into the sky.  The city of Caemlyn flows downhill
from various avenues along the Circle, over the low-rolling hills of the
city's natural landscape.  The plaza west is alive with people, as citizens
and visitors alike find themselves entranced with the entertainers that have
set up there.  Queen's Guardsmen watch over the entertainments, in case
anything goes awry and are more than happy to give directions to those
entering the grand city from the southern Far Madding Gate.

Inner City Circle~
The silver-streaked walls of the Inner City brilliantly reflect the light
of the sun, gleaming the gray stone to almost white.  The Inner City Circle
follows the great walls along the crest of the hill upon which it was built,
providing one of the most level walks in all the city.  The low-rolling
hills of the city spread out from the Inner City Circle in a number of
tightly-knit cobblestone streets, running along the paths the natural
landscape have provided.  Along this stretch of Inner City Circle,
storefronts of white marble and red brick are open to those new to the city,
with many of the shopkeepers tooling their craft in the doorwells of their
store.  A wide plaza opens to the southwest, before the South Gate to the
Inner City.

Junction of Inner City Circle and Hammons Walk~
Branching off from Inner City Circle, Hammons Walk flows downhill towards
Wall Road to the east.  The city seems to roll out from Inner City Circle,
being how it is built upon the crest of one of Caemlyn's highest hills.  The
remainder of the city follows the low-rolling hills of the landscape.  Along
this stretch of the Circle, many storefronts line the east side of the
street.  Within the doorways of these storefronts, the shopkeepers greet
those who pass with a warm welcome and invitation within.  Nestled within
the silver-streaked walls of the Inner City, the Royal Palace rises above
and beyond all it surveys, built upon the highest land in all of Caemlyn. 
Inner City Circle leads towards the East Gate to the north, while turning
towards the west the further south it leads.  A brisk walk across several
blocks leads to the southern Far Madding Gate, leading out from the city.

Inner City Circle~
Inner City Circle and Wall Road East break from eachother to the north,
with this aspect trailing the inside walls of the Inner City.  Following the
crest of one of the New City's highest hills, Inner City Circle continues on
level, while Wall Road East begind sloping downhill.  The walls of the Inner
City tower gray stone over fifty feet in the air, with washes and streaks of
silver and white.  To the east of Inner City Circle, small, yet prosperous
storefronts line the streetside.  Goods and services of all sorts seem
offered along the inside of this street, within buildings of white marble
and red brick.  Most the doors are open along the block and many of the
shopkeepers actually wait in the doorway and pleasantly greet those who pass
by.  Within the walls of the Inner City, the Royal Palace of Caemlyn can be
seen nestled in its bossom.  Spiralling towers of white marble and dome
gleam within, each flying the banner of Andor proudly from their tops.

Fletching Way~
One of the first roads built south of the Queen's Highway, Fletching Way
was named briefly after Arrow Street.  Fletching Way crosses Arrow Street to
the east and west, acting like the namesake feathering of an arrow.  The
bustle of the Arrow Street echoes to the west.  People can be seen going
about their daily routine, as commoners and lords each give room to pass for
the lacquered sedan chairs that are drawn up and down the streets.  The
buildings and homes along Fletching Way are all crafted of grey stone or
white plaster, with few buildings crafted from marble intermingled amongst
them.  The city of Caemlyn is a built on a series of ever-rising hills and
the streets flow evenly between and over these hills.  Within the Inner City
that rises far to the south, the Royal Palace lies atop the highest hill of
the walled city.  It rests atop the hill like a glittering jewel, surrounded
by the silver-streaked walls of the Inner City.

Junction of Faule's Well Way and Fletching Way~
An ogier-built basin that stretches the length of the road of Faule's
Well Way leads from the Inner City Circle to the Queen's Highway.  At each
end of the basin, a winged male statue rises from the fountain, carved in
beautiful silver-streaked white marble.  To the south, Faule's Well Way ends
at the Inner City Circle, while to the north it crosses the Queen's Highway
and becomes Braela's Walk.  The cobblestone of the road has been dutifully
cleaned and shows very little wear from traffic, though the streets are
quite filled with the residents of the city and visitors.  The traffic grows
tight on the Queen's Highway to the north, as peddlers and hawkers mingle
with the citizens of the city.  Within the Inner City to the south, the
Royal Palace lies atop the highest hill of the walled city.  It rests atop
the hill like a glittering jewel, surrounded by the silver-streaked walls of
the Inner City.  Fletching Way runs off here to the east and west, running
through Caemlyn's residential areas west towards the center of the city.

Faule's Well Way~
An ogier-built basin that stretches the length of the road of Faule's
Well Way leads from the Inner City Circle to the Queen's Highway.  At each
end of the basin, a winged male statue rises from the fountain, carved in
beautiful silver-streaked white marble.  To the south, Faule's Well Way ends
at the Inner City Circle, a brisk walk up one of the highest hills in
Caemlyn's New City.  To the north, Faule's Well Way crosses the Queen's
Highway and becomes Braela's Walk.  The cobblestone of the road has been
dutifully cleaned and shows very little wear from traffic, though the
streets are quite filled with the residents of the city and visitors.  The
traffic grows tight on the Queen's Highway to the north, as peddlers and
hawkers mingle with the citizens of the city.  Within the Inner City to the
south, the Royal Palace lies atop the highest hill of the walled city.  It
rests atop the hill like a glittering jewel, surrounded by the
silver-streaked walls of the Inner City.

Junction of Inner City Circle and Faule's Well Way~
Atop one of the higher hills of Caemlyn lies the Inner City Circle, a
long road that follows the natural curves of the wall that surrounds the
Inner City.  From here, one can look down on the New City of Caemlyn,
predominently to the north.  The New City has a crazy-quilt layout, the
smooth cobblestone streets flowing around the city's hilled landscape. 
Beautiful parks and fountains can be seen throughout the city, amidst the
homes and shops of red brick, grey stone and white marble.  Faule's Well Way
leads down into the city to the north, a long basin stretching between twin
fountains running through the center of it.  A single street intersects the
Way to the north before it reaches the main boulevard of the city, the
Queen's Highway.

Fletching Way~
One of the first roads built south of the Queen's Highway, Fletching Way
was named briefly after Arrow Street.  Fletching Way crosses Arrow Street to
the east and west, acting like the namesake feathering of an arrow.  The
buildings and homes along Fletching Way are all crafted of grey stone or
white plaster, with few buildings crafted from marble intermingled amongst
them.  The city of Caemlyn is a built on a series of ever-rising hills and
the streets flow evenly between and over these hills.  Within the Inner City
that rises far to the south, the Royal Palace lies atop the highest hill of
the walled city.  It rests atop the hill like a glittering jewel, surrounded
by the silver-streaked walls of the Inner City.

South Kellerman Way~
Just south of the Queen's Highway, Kellerman Way leads into the
residential quarter of Caemlyn.  To the north, the Highway is alive with
activity as hawkers pan their wares between the pedestrian traffic of the
city.  The homes of white plaster are all decorated bearing the colors of
Andor, with rich crimsons and pristine whites causing the homes to stand
out.  The land rises higher the further south one progresses, until the
walls of the Inner City can be seen like a plush ivory cushion encircling
the Royal Palace of Caemlyn.

Junction of Kellerman's Way and Peregrine Avenue~
Running from the northern Queen's Highway towards Wall Road East, South
Kellerman Way makes it's path through the hilled cobblestone streets of
Caemlyn towards the Inner City.  The quiet bustle of pedestrian life
resonates here, as Caemlyn's citizens go about their daily business.  Women
return from shopping, children laugh and play in the streets, merchants and
workmen return from their day of labor- all happily offering well-wishings
to eachother and those they pass.  The buildings along Kellerman Way all
seem to keep a plaster motif, and are decorated in Andor's livery, crimson
and white.  Peregrine Avenue travels in an east-west direction, through the
quieter residential district south of the Highway.  The land rises higher
the further south one progresses, until the walls of the Inner City can be
seen like a plush ivory cushion encircling the Royal Palace of Caemlyn.

thunder of the Queen's Highway, just a few paces to the north.  Houses and

citizens go about their daily business, wishing eachother greetings as they
pass their neighbors.  The gates surrounding a beautiful park to the east
are twined with ivy.

Junction of the Northern Arc, Arrow Street, and Evening Star Path~
The crazy-quilt layout of Caemlyn's New City has streets stretching off
in all directions.  The Northern Arc was one of the first roads built of the
New City, before the Caemlyn Road was taken into the walls and turned into
the Queen's Highway.  The Northern Arc was used as an alternate route to
cross the city, as often the Queen's Highway is teeming with peddlers. 
Running through the center of the Northern Arc, Arrow Street gets its name
by the Andoran's reference to the Arc as the great bow.  The crossroads here
are alive with the passage of pedestrians and sedan chairs, while the
Queen's Guard is quick to offer its help and services to anyone in need. 
Evening Star Path leads downhill over a worn cobblestone street, leading off
to the northeast residential district of Caemlyn.  Arrow Street south rises
over the hilly landscape of Caemlyn and between two beautiful parks.  To the
north, white plaster and red brick buildings line the road, offering the
busy people of Caemlyn the latest wares and services.

offering help to those in need while on their watch.  This stretch of Arrow
Road runs between two parks, both surrounded by thinly-wrought iron gates
laced with bright flowers and ivy.  Within these parks, beautiful gardens
bloom and small birds of various kinds flutter about.  To the north, the
great bow of the Northern Arc lies, a busy street filled with pedestrians
and sedan chairs.  A small shop to the west seems to hold various
knick-knacks and tools.  Painted in the window is the shope's name
"Johnwin's Rummage and Fine Goods".

The Northern Arc~
The crazy-quilt streets of Caemlyn flows along its hilly landscape,
rising and falling slightly in a series of roads and runs.  This stretch of
the Northern Arc runs along a beautiful garden to the south, and a line of
shops to the north.  The cobblestone way barely shows any sign of wear, even
after the heavy traffic since the years of Caemlyn's beginnings.  To the
east and west, busy intersections cross the Northern Arc, to the west lies
Lion's Pride Way and to the east is Arrow Street.  The Northern Arc was one
of the first roads built of the New City, before the Caemlyn Road was taken
into the walls and turned into the Queen's Highway.  The Arc was used as an
alternate route to cross the city, as often the Queen's Highway is teeming

Gate and the Royal Palace.  It is the second longest road in all of Caemlyn,

colorful and well-decorated road.  The beautiful cobblestone road leads deep
into the city, and is hedged the whole way by small gardens laced with the
crimson and white of Loversknot and Maiden's Hope.  Along the road, Andorans
go about their daily business while smiling and greeting eachother warmly.

east and is lined by a thinly wrought iron gate.  To the west, dozens of
buildings follow the road.  Most are dressed in white plaster, some brick,
and all vary in their size.

Junction of True Man's, Turanin, and Lion's Pride~
The busy junction of True Man's Path and Lion's Pride Way leads off in
all directions.  People walk the cobblestone road in every which way, going
about the business quickly, hardly paying attention to eachother.  True
Man's Path intersects the natural flow of traffic heading along Lion's Pride
Way as it connects the Tar Valon Gate to the Royal Palace.  The further
south into the city Lion's Pride reaches, the more congested the streets
look and the greater variety of people can be found.  Haggling with the
hawkers south can be found Domani, Kandori, even Tairen merchants, all
trying to get a better deal than the next.  Still, the Queen's Guard is
always within eyeshot, keeping the peace in these crowded times, easily
recognizable by the crimson and white livery they wear.  Rolling down to the
northwest, True Man's Path flows between the hilled roads into Caemlyn's
residential quarter.

buildings lining the road to the east, the Lion of Andor flaps, the crimson
and white of her colors flying rampant in the wind.  To the north, the
Lion's Pride Way is interrupted by a busy street criss-crossing it to the
east and west.  A small two-story cottage of white plaster stands to the
east.  An ivory fence is wreathed in ivy and the yellow of Trueheart,
enclosing the home and sheltering it from the shops lining the street.  To
the southwest, a beautiful park is lined by thinly-wrought iron gates, laced
with twining vines and roses.  A small cottage of white stone stands to the
west, a sign outside its humled exterior reading "Sew Whats New".

Fir Way~
The sloping hills of Caemlyn roll in to a lower ground along the Fir Way,
which quarters most the homes of Caemlyn's populace.  Set along the sides of
the cobblestone roads are small gardens centered around Andoran firs, hunter
green needles nestling large pinecones.  The houses here have the luxury of
space around them, with full yards in front and back.  Surrounding many of
these homes are beautifully tended gardens, each of a dazzling array of
colors.  The homes are mostly of white plaster, though some of gray stone
stand at two stories.  Caemlyn's Wall Road opens to the northeast, with a
beautiful garden of crimson and ivory trailing the street.  To the west,
True Man's Path branches off in a southern direction from Fir Way.

Junction of Fir Way and True Man's Path~
The sloping hills of Caemlyn roll in to a lower ground along the Fir Way,
which quarters most the homes of Caemlyn's populace.  Set along the sides of
the cobblestone roads are small gardens centered around Andoran firs, hunter
green needles nestling large pinecones.  The houses here have the luxury of
space around them, with full yards in front and back.  Surrounding many of
these homes are beautifully tended gardens, each of a dazzling array of
colors.  The homes are mostly of white plaster, though some of gray stone
stand at two stories.  A street called True Man's Path leads off to the
south on an eastern angle, heading towards the center of Caemlyn.  Nestled
in the cluster of homes to the south east is a common fountain, where many
families look to share the refreshment.

Cross Street~
In the residential area of Caemlyn, the low-rolling hills are covered by
worn cobblestone roads.  Cross Street runs diagonally between the Wall Road,
north and west, and is intersected by True Man's Path to the west.  Along
these cobblestone roads, the citizens of Caemlyn move about unmolested by
the gaggle of hawkers and merchants from distant lands that cluster in the
center of the city.  Here, the city is quiet save for the sounds of family
living, the soft droning of children's laughter and tears, parental
discontent, and familial joy.  The buildings along this street are built of
white plaster and gray stone, keeping away from the red brick seen
throughout the rest of the city.

True Man's Path~
True Man's Path is a short street that flows directly through the
low-rolling hilled roads of Caemlyn's residential quarter.  The cobblestone
that makes up the road is worn and beaten, but still holds strong beneath
the passage of time and travel.  Unlike the other streets of the residential
quarter, homes of red brick are intermingled with those of white plaster and
gray stone.  True Man's Path runs from Fir Way towards the heart of Caemlyn,
flowing into Lion's Pride Way towards the south.  To the north, a slight
flow of traffic along Fir Way heads towards the Tar Valon Gate at the north
end of Caemlyn, while Cross Street to the south is alive with poeple going
about their daily errands.  In the housing arrangement to the west, a common
fountain looks to supply refreshment to several of the surrounding homes.

that makes up the road is worn and beaten, bit still holds strong beneath
the passage of time and travel.  The homes of the residential quarter seem
mostly of white plaster and ivory-streaked gray stone, with little in the
way of red brick.  To the southeast, the bustle and liveliness of the city
begins to increase, as the streets thicken with people.  The cobblestone
Path is intersected by Cross Street to the north, and the quiet hum of
family life is felt from those homes.

West Turanin Road~
The crazy-quilt streets of Caemlyn roll over the hilly landscape by
stretches of cobblestone roads.  Turanin Road runs from the Wall Road West
to East, crossing through the busy streets of Lion's Pride Way and Arrow
Road.  A beautiful garden with a statuesque fountain lies to the south, with
thinly- wrought iron gates surrounding it, laced with Maiden's Hope white
and Loversknot crimson.  Tall buildings rise to the north of the street,
varying between red brick, white plaster, and gray stone.  Some rise to
heights of two stories, some three.  Directly north, a residence is held in
a white plaster building with wooden panelling and detailed scrollwork.  A
small fencing, barely a foot high, encircles the yard and a sign hanging
above the open door says 'In the Light of Friends'.

Park Lane~
The flowing Park Lane weaves its way between the subtle hills that make
up the New City.  A think cobblestone road leading from the central market
Square to the northeastern residential quarter.  Lining the way are many of
the beautiful parks for which Caemlyn is noted.  One such park lies to the
north, encircled by a thin, iron-wrought gating.  An entrance to the park
can be seen to the east, and from within can be seen a beautiful fountain. 
Fleecing the iron, vines twine in and out, casually intermingled with
Maiden's Hope white or the crimson of Loversknot.  To the northwest, Park
lane is cut off by the Wall Road West.

The Northern Arc~
The crazy-quilt layout of Caemlyn's New City has streets stretching off
in all directions.  Following the natural flow of the hills upon which this
city was built, many roads and runs lead between buildings lining the north
and south of the Northern Arc.  The Northern Arc was one of the first roads
built of the New City, before the Caemlyn Road was taken into the walls and
turned into the Queen's Highway.  The Arc was used as an alternate route to
cross the city, as often the Queen's Highway is teeming with peddlers.  The
heavily trod upon cobblestones of the Arc still seem no worse for wear, no
matter how often they are traveled.  To the north, a red-roofed building
warmly invites entrance, the sign hanging from the second of its three
stories shows a knight kneeling before a queen.  Barrels line the outside of
the building to the south, and the smell of warm baked bread fills the air.

the east, while its stables lie directly north.

Gate and the Royal Palace.  It is the second longest road in all of Caemlyn,
being surpassed only by the Queen's Highway, though it is easiest the most
colorful and well-decorated road.  The beautiful cobblestone road leads deep
into the city, and is hedged the whole way by small gardems laced with the
crimsom and white of Loversknot and Maiden's Hope.  The busy streets bustle
with life, as hawkers mill about, shouting, screaming, and peddling their
wares from the walkways, while sedan chairs are drawn with lords and ladies
throughout the city.  To the northwest, a beautiful building stands over two
stories, with a gleaming golden dome covering it.  Hanging from the windows
of the buildings lining the road to the east, the Lion of Andor flaps, the
crimson and white of her colors flying rampant in the wind.  To the north,
the Northern Arc of Caemlyn interrupts the flow of traffic heading down the
Lion's Pride Way.  To the south, one of the beautiful gardens of Caemlyn
splits the Pride in two, the traffic seeming to suggest that the primary
road bares to the east, although the street signs and flagrant banners of
Andor suggest west.

This is one of the many picturesque gardens that line the white

direction, it is lined on all sides by a thinly-wrought iron gating. 
Fleecing the iron, vines twine in and out, casually intermingled with
Maiden's Hope white or the crimson of Loversknot.  The thin hedges that
skirt the garden are interrupted by the white cobblestone walkways that lead
from the benches to the center fountain.  There is a relative sweetness in
the air, and the sounds of everyday bustle are washed away by the flitting
of birds in the grasses and the soft sound of flowing waters from the
fountain.

lane is lined on both sides by thin gardens, and the beautiful parks on
either side of the road are in full bloom of the crimson and white of
Maiden's Hope and Loversknot.  From within those parks, white marble
monuments and fountains stretch towards the sky in dynamic poses and
carefully tended hedges take the shape of animals and figures.  The Lion's
Pride Way lies to the north-west and the bustle of the Merchant's Square is
alive to the south-east.

stone, and red brick rise to different heights along the side of the road,
each decorated in various ways to distinguish family lineage and familial
custom.  To the east is a large garden, a thin iron fence wreathed in
beautiful flowers surrounds it.  Within the garden, the statue of a female
form looks expectantly to the east.  The cobblestone street makes its way
through the slightly hilled landscape of Caemlyn.  The crazy-quilt streets
of the city grow more curvacious to the south, as the hills rise higher

Tilaen's Folly~
The normal hubhub of the city quiets some along Tilaen's Folly, which
lends itself to be more of a residential area than the rest of the
commercialized city.  Few shops line this high-hilled road, as most of the
residences are beautiful white plaster with worked wood framing.  Two
intersections find their way at both the eastern and western ends of this
road, the one to the west seeming to lead further into the heart of the
city, while the one to the east leading towards the towering New City walls.
To the north, a thin iron fence wreathed in beautiful flowers surrounds a
large garden.  Within the garden, the statue of a female form looks

At this intersection, Tilaen's Folly and Braela's Walk cross.  Braela's
Walk flows from the north to the south of Caemlyn, sloping downwards along
the hilly cobblestone streets as it progresses north.  Tilaen's Folly leads
to the east and west, With a large garden dominating the block to the
northeast.  Along both these streets, the buildings seem to become more
residential.  The walls of the New City tower in the distance to the north
and east, easily rising fifty feet in the air.  People come to and fro from
the homes that line the streets, each one offering neighborly greetings to
those already making their way through the day.  The homes vary in their
architecture here as they do in the rest of the city, but in the residential
area the houses are mostly of varying types of white plaster homes.

Tilaen's Folly~
The normal hubhub of the city quiets some along Tilaen's Folly, which
lends itself to be more of a residential area than the rest of the
commercialized city.  Few shops line this low-hilled road, as most of the
residences are beautiful white plaster with worked wood framing.  Two
intesections find their way at both the eastern and western ends of this
road, the one to the west seeming to lead further into the heart of the
Caemlyn.  Before the intersection to the east, a large inn of white plaster
and deep oak pannelling seems to be a draw for some of the more affluent
citizens of Caemlyn.  A stone marker rises a dozen hands tall to the west,
declaring the intersecting road as Arrow Street.

Evening Star Path~
The normal bustle of the busy city life dwindles here away here on
Evening Star Path.  The path calmly makes its way from the central Arrow
Street east towards the Wall Road, running through Caemlyn's Residential
District.  The homes here are built of the swirling grey-streaked stone and
pristine white plaster that make up most of Caemlyn's architecture.  Most of
the houses rise to a second floor, but a few still tend to stay a single
story.  The cobblestone of Evening Star Path flows down a slight decline as
it leads towards Wall Road to the east, while directly to the west it
inclines sharply to merge with Arrow Street and the Northern Arc.
