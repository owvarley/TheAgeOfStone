  And the Glory of the Light did shine upon him.
  And the Peace of the Light did he give men.
  Binding nations to him.  Making one of many.
  Yet the shards of hearts did give wounds.
  And what was once did come again
       --in fire and storm
  splitting all in twain.
  For his peace...
       --for his peace...
  ... was the peace ...
  ... was the peace ...
  ... of the sword.
  And the Glory of the Light did shine upon him.

--from "Glory of the Dragon"
composed by Meane sol Ahelle, the Fourth Age
