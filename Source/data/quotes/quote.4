  The unstained tower breaks and bends knee to the forgotten sign.
  The seas rage, and stormclouds gather unseen.
  Beyond the horizon, hidden fires swell, and serpents nestle in the bosom.
  What was exalted is cast down, what was cast down is raised up.
  Order burns to clear his path.

  --"The Prophecies of the Dragon"
  translation by Jeorad Manyard
  Governor of the Province of Andor for
  the High King, Artur Paendrag Tanreall
