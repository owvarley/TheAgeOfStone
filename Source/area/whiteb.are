halberd~
This halberd has a good balance to it, but its weight makes it difficult
to wield.  The dark oak haft sets off the gleaming head of this halberd. 
The very sharp blade of the head is opposed by a large spike on the back,
with another long spike on top that allows this weapon to be used for
piercing an opponent.  There are no identifying marks on the head of the
halberd, but the haft has several markings etched into it.  The etchings on
the haft seem to be roses with their vine and thorns, climbing the length of
the haft.  Mixed in with the carved roses on the haft, are several other
carvings of rampant lions.  These carvings suggest that this halberd is
originally from Andor, and it was possibly a weapon owned by a member of the
Queen's Guard.  A skilled warrior, with this weapon, would be hard to match.

hand~
This axe has been precision balanced for use with one hand.  Similar in
size to a hatchet, this axe has two blades that greatly resemble those of a
woodsman's axe.  Each blade is roughly the size of a man's hand, and the
haft a little longer than a forearm.  This axe looks as if it originated in

axe~
This axe has been precision balanced for use with one hand.  Similar in
size to a hatchet, this axe has two blades that greatly resemble those of a
woodsman's axe.  Each blade is roughly the size of a man's hand, and the
haft a little longer than a forearm.  This axe looks as if it originated in
Saldaea, because its construction is much like that which Salaean
woodcutters use, except this axe is meant for combat.  In combat, this axe

battle~
This axe is very heavy and unbalanced.  Its long oak haft is darkened
with blood and sweat, and is three fingers thick.  Several notches and
scratches scar the haft, yet do not weaken it.  The large, steel axe head
has been blackened from use, yet is still so sharp it draws blood to the
touch.  The large axe head has a wide blade that curves wickedly, and has a
long spike, nearly a foot long, opposite the blade.  The axe is very plain,
yet very functional.  It is meant for killing and combat, but requires a
large man to wield it.  The plain style, yet excellent craftmanship of this
weapon, coupled with the blackened axe head and haft, could possibly mean
that this battle axe originated in Saldaea, yet any of the borderlands could
have produced it as there are no identifying marks.  This an excellent
weapon for an experienced warrior that can handle the weight.

falchion~
This sword is long and cumbersome, yet exquisite in design and beauty. 
The wide, curving blade is forged from the finest steel and is extremely
sharp.  The blade looks to be covered with markings of some type.  Upon
closer inspections, the markings seem to be several star-shaped, and moon,
half-moon and quarter-moon shaped markings that cover the entire blade on
both sides.  The pattern of the markings is unrecognizable, yet look to
possibly have originated with the Sea Folk, as they use such symbols at
times.  If this fine sword did originate with the Sea Folk, it must have
travelled a strange but interesting story to have ended up here.  This sword
is quite cumbersome and long, yet after a while, lends itself to easy use. 
With some practice, this sword could become very deadly in the right hands.

This beautifully crafted sword is remarkable in every aspect.  Its
excellent balance lends itself to ease of use, but also allows an
experienced swordsman to be more capable and deadly.  This sword was
obviously not crafted in Whitebridge, thus needs a closer examination that
reveals markings on the blade.  The small, nearly hidden markings are of a
black hawk, possibly indicating that this sword was, in fact, forged in
Shienar, and not Andor.  The blade is extremely sharp, but does not seem to
have been created by Aes Sedai, only forged by a master weaponsmith and
taken care of.  The blade has an edge on only one side, and curves slightly,
there are no decorations or markings to be seen other than the single, small
black hawk.  The sheath is made of simple black leather, and only hides a
magnificent weapon that any swordsman would be proud to own.

longsword~
This beautifully crafted sword is remarkable in every aspect.  Its
excellent balance lends itself to ease of use, but also allows an
experienced swordsman to be more capable and deadly.  This sword was
obviously not crafted in Whitebridge, thus needs a closer examination that
reveals markings on the blade.  The small, nearly hidden markings are of a
black hawk, possibly indicating that this sword was, in fact, forged in
Shienar, and not Andor.  The blade is extremely sharp, but does not seem to
have been created by Aes Sedai, only forged by a master weaponsmith and
taken care of.  The blade has an edge on only one side, and curves slightly,
there are no decorations or markings to be seen other than the single, small
black hawk.  The sheath is made of simple black leather, and only hides a
magnificent weapon that any swordsman would be proud to own.

Center of Whitebridge Square~
Here at the center of the city of Whitebridge there are people moving in
every direction.  Some are headed west towards the White Bridge that looms
beyond the city, and some are headed east towards the Caemlyn Road.  The
entire square and streets of Whitebridge are paved in worn cobblestone . 
The cobblestone seems to be in good repair here, as there are very little
weeds or grass growing through the cracks.  There is a large stone well here
that is full of sweet tasting, cool water.

The West Gate to the City of Whitebridge~
Here at the west gate to the city of Whitebridge, there are two extremely
large doors, banded with thick black iron, standing open to allow passage in
or out of the city.  The stone walls that surround the city are over twice
the height of a full-grown man, and made of large stones dragged from the
banks of the River Arinelle.  Travelling to the west will lead out of the
city to the east foot of the White Bridge.  To the east is the Whitebridge
Square.

Bridge spans the river towards the west bank of the River Arinelle.  To the
east, the west gate to the city of Whitebridge stands with its thick,
iron-bound, wooden doors open.  The large stone wall that surrounds the city
is over twice the height of a full-grown man, and made from large stones
dragged from the banks of the River Arinelle.  The pleasant smell of the
river mixed in with the harsh odor of fish from the docks waft from below.

Above the River Arinelle on the White Bridge~
Here high above the River Arinelle on the White Bridge there is a wide
view of the river and the docks below.  The surface of the bridge is
deceiving as it looks like glass, yet is never slippery.  The bridge will
not even chip under any circumstance, let alone crack, its strength is
amazing and makes this bridge bring wonder to the minds of all.  To the east
is the east foot of the bridge and the city of Whitebridge.  To the west is

West Foot of the White Bridge~
The hard packed dirt road meets the west foot of the White Bridge here. 
To the north and to the south, the sloping banks of the River Arinelle fall
steeply into the waters below.  To the east, the glass-appearing White
Bridge spans the river towards the east bank and the city of Whitebridge.

First View of the White Bridge~
There is a fine view of the White Bridge from here.  The spidery lacework
of the bridge gleam milky-white with a grace that inspires awe.  The bridge
looks to be crafted from a single piece of glass.  The River Arinelle rushes
along the base of the White Bridge.  The hard packed dirt road meets with
the foot of the White Bridge to the east, where the bridge seems to almost
dwarf the city of Whitebridge beyond.

Towards the Docks~
Here the cobblestone street ends at a wood stairway that leads down the
bank of the River Arinelle towards the docks.  The stairway is made from
large timbers driven into the bank with planks nailed across the top for
steps.  From here, most of the rooftops of the buildings on the dock are at
eye level.  Several piers and warehouses can be seen from here, as well as a
few boats.  To the south is the west gate to the city.

South West Wall Road~
There are very few people here at all.  This street, just like all the
streets of Whitebridge, are paved in worn cobblestone.  The cobblestone
seems to be in need of repair here, as weeds and grass is growing out
through the cracks.  This road follows along the inside of the city wall,
and continues on to the north and to the south.  The stone walls that
surround the city are over twice the height of a full-grown man, and made of
large stones dragged from the banks of the River Arinelle.

The Docks~
The air smells like fish here on the docks.  The docks are made from
large timbers tied to tar-coated pilings.  All around, workers rush about
with their work, and fishermen mend their nets, while merchants transfer
their goods from boat to carriage and prepare for travel.  A large inn is to
the east.  A wide set of wooden stairs, set into the River Bank, lead up
into the city.  The docks continue on to the north.

Weapon and Armor Shop~
Here in the weapon and armor shop, there is a faint odor of oil.  The
floor is lined with thick oak planks, but still squeaks when walked on. 
Several shelves line the walls displaying the weapons and armor throughout
the room.  The craftmanship of the shopkeeper's wares are of the finest
quality.  A thin coating of oil on the weapons and armor give them a
luminescent glow as they reflect the light brilliantly.  Covering most of
the east wall from floor to ceiling, is a large tapestry with small
half-moons embroidered along the edge and a large half-moon in the center
set on a dark-blue background.  The exit to the north leads back outside to

fill the air.  The room has not been cleaned in a while, as dirt and debris
cover the floor and the cobwebs dominate most of the ceiling.  The exit to
the west leads back to the main room of the barracks.

Office of the Captain of the Militia Guard~
This room is a lot cleaner than the rest of the barracks.  The floor has
been scrubbed clean and there are no cobwebs.  The simple furnishings have
also been kept neat and clean in an almost methodical manner.  The door to
the east leads back to the main room of the barracks.

Common Room of the Boarding House~
This room is dimly lit, with only a few candles in their holders for
light.  The dark oak planks that line the floor and walls also lend to the
dim lighting.  The smell of perfume is almost overpowering, yet sweet none
the less.  There are several tapestries hanging from the walls, most of them
dark-red or violet with white lace trim.  There is a stairway here that
leads upstairs to the rooms.  The kitchen is to the north and the reception
area is to the south.

Kitchen of the Boarding House~
This room has a little more light than the others.  The walls are lined
with several candles that brighten the room greatly.  The floors have been
scrubbed clean, and the smells of the last meal cooked seem to cover the
smell of perfume here.  There are two fireplaces on the north wall that are
used for cooking, although they are both cold now and unused.  The common
room is to the south.

Second Floor of the Boarding House~
Here on the second floor, the smell of perfume is almost overpowering,
yet sweet none the less.  It is very dimly lit, as the only light is coming
from two candles in their brass holders, one on the west wall, and one on
the east wall.  The doors to the north and to the south lead to the private
guest rooms.  The stairway leads up to the third floor, and back down to the
common room.

An Occupied Room~
This room is dark because the candles are not lit, and the single, small
window on the other side of the room, is covered with a dark shade.  The
floor is the same dark oak that lines the rest of the buildings floors, but
the walls are completely covered with tapestries and decorations.  The sweet
smell of perfume is stronger here in the room.  The door to the south leads
back out to the hallway and stairs.

Above the River Arinelle on the White Bridge~
Here high above the River Arinelle on the White Bridge there is a wide
view of the river and the docks below.  The surface of the bridge is
deceiving as it looks like glass, yet is never slippery.  The bridge will
not even chip under any circumstance, let alone crack, its strength is
amazing and makes this bridge bring wonder to the minds of all.  To the east
is the east foot of the bridge and the city of Whitebridge.  To the west is
the west foot of the bridge and a dirt road that continues beyond.  The
pleasant smell of the river mixed with the harsh odor of fish from the docks
waft from below.

The Caemlyn Road~
Here the Caemlyn Road is a slightly rutted, hard packed dirt road.  There
is a thick hedge of bushes lining the road to the north and to the south
that act as a fence of sorts to keep travellers on the road and out of the
farmers' fields.  Beyond the hedges, to both the north and to the south,
there are several haystacks that dot the horizon.  Far to the west is the
city of Whitebridge.  The Caemlyn Road continues on to the east.
