0 BANDING~
The Banding skill is often used by those who work better in groups than
they do alone.  A player with Banding gains a +1 to hit and +1 damage bonus
for every PC member of the party he is in.  Players grouping with someone
with the Banding skill gain a to hit/ damage bonus equal to their skill
ranking.

Ie, Campaigners have Banding(1), all grouping with Campaigners get +1 to hit
and +1 to damage.  Younglings might have Banding(2), so people grouping with
a Youngling would gain +2 to hit and +2 damage.

0 CHANNEL~
CHANNEL
Syntax: channel <weave> <target>

Before you can channel a weave or talent, you have to practice it.  The
more you practice, the higher chance you have of success. Also, you must
have embraced or seized The One Power.

The <target> is optional.  Many weaves which need targets will use an
appropriate default target, especially during combat.

If the weave name is more than one word, then you must use quotes.
Example: weave 'clear poison' frag.  Quoting is optional for single-word
weaves. You can also abbreviate the weave name.

When you weave an offensive ability or talent, the victim usually gets a
saving throw. The effect of your weave is reduced or eliminated if the
victim makes the saving throw successfully.

** WARNING: Drawing more of the One Power than you can handle may
burn out your character or SLAY them outright.

0 CHANNELING CHANNELER~
CHANNELING, CHANNELERS

The Wheel of Time turns, and Ages come and pass. The One Power (or Source)
is what drives the Wheel of Time. This Power is seperated into two equal
parts, the female Saidar and the male Saidin. Men and women who can use and
direct currents (also called flows) of this Power are called "channelers".
Most women channelers are known as Aes Sedai, who train in the White Tower.

However, back in the Age of Legends, an Age past and an Age yet to come, a
man by the name of Lews Therin (also called the Dragon) and 100 of his
companions journied into Shayol Ghul to seal the Dark One into a prison. As
a counterstroke, the Dark One tainted the male half of the Source, saidin.

This taint drove the male channelers insane, and they wreaked havoc on the
world in their madness. This was called the Breaking. This Breaking did
many different, horrible things to different places and people. Mountains
rose where there were once valleys. Part of a pacifist people were thrown
into a barren land. Ogier were forced away from their steddings, some to be
taken by the Longing and die.

Saidin is still tainted today, and male channelers are feared and hated,
still doomed to go mad and die. A faction of the Aes Sedai, one of seven, is
dedicated to finding every one of these channelers, and severing their
contact to the One Power permanently. These women call themselves of the Red
Ajah.

Saidin and saidar are supposedly to be handled in two seperate ways. Saidin
is almost like a torrent, and must be seized. Saidar is gentle, and it is
said you must embrace it, surrendering. Training in both is required to do
even the smallest thing.

52 CHECKNAME~
CHECKNAME
Syntax: checkname <name>

`Y|`w   Founded by Lothair Mantelar during the War of the       `Y|`w
`W|`w   Hundred Years in FY 1021, the Children of the Light is  `W|`w
`Y|`w   an organization dedicated to the defeat of the Dark One `Y|`w
`y|`w   and the destruction of all Darkfriends. From their      `y|`w
`Y|`w   central headquarters, the Fortress of the Light in      `Y|`w
`W|`w   Amador, the Children work to counter the work of the    `W|`w
`Y|`w   Shadow's minions in the White Tower and to bring order  `Y|`
`y|`w   to the world under the Light. The following requirements`y|`w
`Y|`w   were first defined by the Founder and are still followe `Y|`w
`W|`w   to this day.                                            `W|`w
`y|`w   1) Male only: To join the ranks one must have both      `y|`w
`Y|`w   fortitude of mind and body, to resist the temptations of`Y|`w
`W|`w   the Shadow and to destroy its agents in the world.      `W|`w
`y|`w   2) Level 15: The life of a Child of the Light requires  `y|`w
`Y|`w   a level of physical and mental maturity before one is   `Y|`w
`W|`w   prepared for the rigors of such a dedicated lifestyle.  `W|`w
`y|`w   3) Nationality: Men have always been welcomed from every`y|`w
`Y|`w   nation, even those born in the Shadow tainted land of   `Y|`w
`W|`w   Tar Valon. However, because of their unknown allegiance `W|`w
`Y|`w   to the Light, men of the Waste, the Seafolk Islands, and`Y|`w
`y|`w   the land of Seandar will not be admitted within the     `y|`w
`Y|`w   ranks of the Children.                                  `Y|`w
`Y|`w   4) Classes: Warriors and Rogues only are welcome. All   `Y|`w
`y|`w   channelers, both male and female, are tainted by the    `y|`w
`Y|`w   Shadow and will be hanged upon discovery.               `Y|`w
`Y|`w   5) Pledge: Admission into the Children is for life. Any `Y|`w
`y|`w   deserters will be hunted by all legions at all costs.   `y|`w
`Y|`w   Retirement and banishment are the only ways of exist,   `Y|`w
`W|`w   with the latter being almost as ignoble as desertion.   `W|`w
`y|`w   6) Lifestyle: Children will be expected to serve the    `y|`w
`Y|`w   Light in every aspect of their lives. The accumulation  `Y|`w
`W|`w   of excess, drunkedness, and salacious behavior are all  `W|`w
`Y|`w   temptations of the Shadow and are to be avoided on pain `Y|`w
`y|`w   of cleansing.                                           `y|`w
`W|`w   7) Responsibilities: A Child will obey the orders of his`W|`w
`Y|`w   superiors, with the Lord Captain Commander coming above `Y|`w
`y|`w   all others. Any witness of suspicious acts should be    `y|`w
`Y|`w   relayed to your commander and any sightings of Aes Sedai`Y|`w
`W|`w   should be reported immediately so that swift action may `W|`w
`Y|`w   be used to counter the Shadow's work.                   `Y|`w
`Y|`w   8) RP: All Children will be expected to roleplay at all `Y|`w
`W|`w   times. This is not a haven for PKers who don't want to  `W|`w
`Y|`w   RP, this is a guild. Nor are all Children bloodthirsty  `Y|`w
`y|`w   rejects of society. You may choose to play one of that  `y|`w
`Y|`w   type, or you may want to RP a preacher, an aesthetic, or`Y|`w
`W|`w   a soldier bound by a code of honor. Original RP is      `W|`w

56 CHOWN~
CHOWN
Syntax: chown <item> <target>

Chown removes an item from a player and does not inform them of the
removal. chown will work best when used with invlist to snatch 'illegal'
items from folks who shouldn't have them'.
   See also WIZHELP.
~

0 CIRCLE~
Syntax: circle <target>

Known and feared throughout the realms, the Aiel are the deadliest
warriors on a whole as a nation.  Their incredible speed of the Dance is
captured in the Circle guild skill.  Quickly darting past their opponent, an
Aiel can firmly plant his spears in their back.  These attacks do more
damage than regular attacks, but not more than premeditated rogue backstabs.
This skill is a difficult one to master, as warriors in combat are always on
their guard and difficult to bypass.  
 
This is a Guild specific skill: Aiel, Shaido.
~

51 CLAN~
CLAN
Syntax: clan <guild name>

This command is used in redit to make rooms specifically allowing members of
the named guild only. This allows members of guilds to have their own areas
and meeting places, as societies would in the Wheel of Time world.

  See also GUILD, PROMOTE, REDIT.
~

0 CLOAK~
Syntax: cloak
 
The guild skill of the Gaidin, Cloak allows the Warder to enfold himself
in his fancloth cloak and make himself virtually undetectable.  While
wrapped in his cloak, the Gaidin is unable to be targetted by spells,
effects, communiques, or socials.  This effect does last throughout  
combat, making the Warder a deadly opponent, indeed.  Of course, the
Warder needs to be wearing his guild-acquired fancloth cloak, or he cannot
use the skill.
 
This is a Guild specific skill: Gaidin.
~

52 CLONE~
CLONE
Syntax:
  clone obj <object>
  clone mob <mobile>
  clone <name>

The clone command duplicates an object or mobile.  The level of item or mobile
that may be cloned depends on your level.  The target object or mob must be in
the same room as you, or in your posession.  Strung and set information is
preserved by clone, as well as any spell effects and container contents or
mobile inventory, except for items which are too high for you to clone.
Strung extended descriptions on objects are not kept, however.
 
  See also WIZHELP.
~

-1 COLOR~
COLOR
Syntax: color

  Toggles ANSI color on or off.

  Using colors in things like, your title, pet's description, etc, is
really easier than it may look at first.  First off, to add color to
something, you must use a "caret" key (the one just under the "tilde", the
key right next to "!"(#1) on the top of your keyboard) followed by the
appropriate color code.   These codes are as follows:

Dark Colors    Bright Colors
------------------------------------
  `bb Blue`w       `BB Blue`w
  `cc Cyan`w       `CC Cyan`w
  `gg Green`w      `GG Green`w
  `mm Magenta`w    `MM Magenta`w
  `yy Yellow`w     `YY Yellow`w
  `ww white`w      `WW White`w
  `rr Red`w        `RR Red`w
  (n for black)    `NN Grey`w

 You should also end your color string, by using the default, "reset"
color of dark white.

  `BE`CN`YJ`GO`MY`w!

1)  Do not kill mortals, do not kill mortals, do not kill mortals.
    This includes transferring/summoning them to aggressive mobs.

2)  Do not cheat for ANY mortal in ANY way, especially your own.

    healing/restoring, casting protection spells <armor, sanct>,
    and softening up or altering mobs.

5)  DO NOT use reboot.  <--- Note, simple English.

6)  Do not give out free equipment.  You don't need to win brownie
    points with the mortals.  Quest are fine but handing out items
    isn't.

7)  A note on quests: Quests are a good thing, more or less, BUT
    do not give out overly extravagant prizes.  Exercise some
    common sense here folks.  Do not load items more than 4 levels
    below their normal level (i.e. no level 5 ogre gauntlets).

8)  Do not undermine the authority of a higher level god.  If you
    see that someone has been frozen or nochannelled do not restore
    their priveleges.  They are being punished for a reason.

9)  Do not try to overrule each other.

10) Trusted mortals:  Do not use your god powers to help your mortal
    character.  If you do, your trust will be taken away.

1 CUENDILLAR HEARTSTONE~
CUENDILLAR, HEARTSTONE

Cuendillar, also called heartstone, is an indestructible substance created
during the Age of Legends. Any known force used in an attempt to break it is
absorbed, making the heartstone itself stronger.

Items made of cuendillar are extremely rare and highly prized. It is said
that the Seals on the Dark One's prison were made of cuendillar, and that
this seemingly indestructible is breaking somehow.

  See also DARK ONE, AGE OF LEGENDS.
~

-1 Campaigner~
Campaigners are the veterans of the realm's armies.  For one reason or
another, they band together, live, fight, and die together in the maintained
armies of the various nations.  Whether a Child of the Light, an Illianer
Campanion, or a Queen's Guardsman, all Campaigners are duly trained soldiers
who work better in groups than they do on their own.  As such, a lone
soldier might not prove to be much of a threat, but a group of Campaigners
is a force to be reckoned with.

0 DAGGER WHIP MACE AXE SWORD SPEAR POLEARM EXOTIC~
In this gaming environment there are eight different varieties of melee
weapons.  Because of the different fighting techniques used in wielding
these weapons, they have varying learning curves, damage ratings, and attack
capabilities.  This means that some weapons will be easier to learn, others
will do greater damage, and others will penetrate certain armor types
quicker.  Your class also also play a part in these factors.  
 
The damage ratings of weapons is listed below, from  to most:
1) Dagger                     5) Axe
2) Whip                       6) Sword
3) Mace                       7) Exotic
4) Spear                      8) Polearm
 
Please keep in mind that if a weapon is two-handed, it may ignore these
rules of thumb.  Weapons flagged 'twohands' gain bonus' beyond this file.
 
See also BOW, ARROW.
~

0 DAMAGE~
Both characters and MOBs have a hit point statistic.  Combat is completed
when either the character or the MOB fall below 0 hit points, or if either
flees.  The damage inflicted by your weapon is dependent upon several
variables.  

Some weapons do more damage than others.  Daggers do the least amount of
damage of all types, while polearms tend to do the most.  

Weapons of higher levels tend to do more damage than their lower level
counterparts.  

The more damage you have suffered, the weaker your attacks will be.  

Damage messages are reported in terms of how much damage you do in
comparison to your opponent's current hit points.  Damage messages are
reported in increasing syntax.  Meaning the closer you get to killing your
opponent, messages may be lower case, upper case, or flanked with *** or
>>>.  

See also COMBAT, FLEE, WIMPY.  
~

0 DAMDICE~
DAMDICE

A high number of dice makes for less variance in mobiles hitpoints.
Suggested values are:

       Level      dice       min      min    mean
        1         1d2+0       1        2       2

-1 DARKFRIENDS~
DARKFRIENDS

Adherents of the Dark One. They believe they will gain great power
and rewards, even immortality, when he is freed.  Secretive of necessity,
they organize into groups called "circles," with members of one circle
rarely, if ever, known to members of another.  Rank in the outside world
has no bearing on rank within the circles; a king or queen who was a
Darkfriend would be expected to obey a begger who gave the proper signs.
Among themselves, they sometimes use the ancient name Friends of the Dark.
 
  See also DARK ONE.
~

-1 DEAF QUIET~
DEAF
Syntax: deaf

The deaf toggle turns off incoming tells, helpfull if you are being bombarded
by messages from other players.  You can still use reply (see 'help reply')
to reply to people who were telling you before you went deaf, although you
cannot reply to a deaf person unless you or they are a diety (it's mostly
useful for sending a quick "I'm being spammed so I went deaf" message to a
person).

QUIET
Syntax: quiet
 
The QUIET toggle turns off all incoming messages from a source outside of
the present room you are in.  This is useful in role-play, so you will
not be distracted by anything going on outside of your present room.  Tells,
channels, and lines will be tuned out.
 
  See also COMMUNICATE, SAY, TELL.
~

0 DEATH~
DEATH

When your character is reduced to 0 hp, you are considered stunned.
After a time of being stunned, your character will awake at either their
recall point or their guild's morgue.  Through player-killing, your
character may be permanently killed and lost (see HELP PK).

Any weaves which were affecting you are cancelled by being stunned.

Following and groups are not affected by being stunned.

You lose experience points for being bested in battle.  The amount you
lose is two-thirds the way back to the beginning of your level.

  See also PK, GUILD.
~

59 DENY~
DENY
Syntax: deny <name>

Deny locks a character out of a game permanently, rendering their character
name unusable.  It may only be removed by editing the file, for this reason
freeze is usually preferred.
 
  See also WIZHELP.
~

0 DESCRIPTION RDESC TITLE~
DESCRIPTION
Syntax: description
Places you into the editor where you can edit your characters description.
Descriptions are a valued tool in role play, and are highly encouraged in
the WoT system. Many guilds will demand that your character have an 'ic' or
"in character" description.

RDESC
Syntax: rdesc <desc>
Rdesc allows you to change the way you are seen by others in the
same room.  In effect, it changes your character's long description.
 
TITLE
Syntax: title <title>
TITLE sets your title on the Who list to a given string.

-1 DIRT 'DIRT KICKING'~
DIRT KICKING
Syntax: dirt

Consider by some to be a cowardly skill, dirt kicking gives the clever
combatant a chance to blind his opponent by casting dirt into his eyes.  The
blindness does not last long, but can provide an edge in combat.  Dexterity
helps in hitting or avoiding a dirt kick.  Only warriors and thieves may
learn this skill.

Disable is used normally when a command is causing mud crashes. Disable
can be used to disable any command but disable including directions and
even quit. Disable by it's self will show which commands are disabled the 
level of the person who disabled it and the name of the person who
disabled it. Reenabling commands that are disabled without getting the
person who disabled it first can cause unintended problems and should be
avoided. Immortals of a lower level cannot reenable commands disabled by
a higher level immortal.

-1 DISARM~
DISARM
Syntax: disarm

Disarm is a somewhat showy and unreliable skill, designed to relieve your
opponent of his weapon.  The best possible chance of disarming occurs when you
are skilled both your own and your opponent's weapon. Only talented rogues
and warriors may learn this skill.
 
  See also ROGUE, WARRIOR.
~

57 DISCONNECT~
DISCONNECT
Syntax: disconnect <name/socketnumber>

Disconnect breaks a player's link to the game. Disconnect works also on
players still in the creation process. This is a non-lethal way of getting 
rid of spammers and annoying players.
 
  See also WIZHELP.
~

54 DISGUISE~
DISGUISE
Syntax: disguise [create|short|long|name] <description>
Syntax: disguise create [optional name]

you have the following options: 

disguise short <short description>
disguise long <long description>
disguise name <name for new disguise>

"desc" will place you in the description editor.
~

-1 DODGE~
DODGE

In the words of one wise warrior, 'the best way to block a blow is to not
be where it lands'.  The dodge skill honors this tradition, by improving the
character's natural agility to the point where many blows will miss the
target. The chance of dodging is also affected by the dexterity of the
attacker and the target.  Any class may learn dodging.
~

-1 DRAGONSWORN~
DRAGONSWORN

General term used for supporters of the Dragon Reborn, usually by
those who either oppose him or at least think to remain neutral.  In fact,
many given that name have never sworn any sort of oath, and it is
frequently applied to brigands as well, some of whom claim the name in the
hopes that it will quell resistance.  A great many atrocities have been
committed by people claiming to be Dragonsworn.
~

1 DREADLORDS~
DREADLORDS

Men and women able to channel who went over to the Shadow during the Trolloc
Wars, acting as generals over armies of Trollocs and Darkfriends. They are
often confused with Forsaken by the less well-educated.

Syntax: fill  <object>
Syntax: pour  <object> out
Syntax: pour  <object> <object>
Syntax: pour  <object> <character>

When you are thirsty, DRINK something.

0 DROP GET GIVE PUT TAKE~
DROP, GET, GIVE, PUT
Syntax: drop <object>
Syntax: drop <amount> coins
Syntax: get  <object>
Syntax: get  <object> <container>
Syntax: give <object> <character>
Syntax: give <amount> coins <character>
Syntax: put  <object> <container>

from a corpse.  TAKE is a synonym for get.

GIVE gives an object, or some coins, to another character.

PUT puts an object into a container.

DROP, GET and PUT understand the object names 'ALL' for all objects and
'ALL.object' for all objects with the same name.

~

54 ECHO GECHO PECHO~
ECHO, GECHO, PECHO
Syntax: echo <message>
Syntax: gecho <message>
Syntax: pecho <character> <message>

These commands all perform similar functions.  Echo sends the message to all
characters in the same room as the user, with no indication of who sent it. 
Gecho does the same for all players connected to the game, and pecho sends
the message to the player specified as the target.  Any higher-level Imm
will see a prompt in front of your message, informing him or her that it is
a echoed message.  

Using these commands to feign a specific character's action that is
inappropriate is grounds for demotion.  

See also WIZHELP.  
~

58 EDSKILL~
EDSKILL
Syntax: edskill <class> <skill/weave> <level>.

Edskill allows you a method online for adjusting the level of a skill or
weave for each class. Using edskill if you feel a skill is set too high
for a class or too low it can be adjusted at your leisure. Another benefit
is that you do not have to recompile and reboot to adjust skills and spells 
which allows you to be more flexible in the balancing your classes.
 
  See also WIZHELP.
~

0 EMBRACE~
When a woman reaches for the half of the One Power known as Saidar, it is
generally felt as surrendering oneself to the Power.  This embrace then
allows the woman to use and control the Power as she so wishes.  Not all
women can channel.  While most female channelers were taught the release
that allows a woman to channel, there are some who can touch the Power with
an inborn spark.  Those with the spark and learn use of the Power outside of
teaching are known as Wilders.

~

0 EMOTE PMOTE~
EMOTE, PMOTE
Syntax: emote <action>

EMOTE is used to express emotions or actions.  Besides EMOTE, there are
several dozen built-in social commands, such as CACKLE, HUG, and THANK
(type socials or help socials for a listing).

PMOTE is similar to emote, but will substitute you and your for a target's
name (i.e. pmote bonks Alander will be read as bonks you by Alander, and
as bonks Alander by everyone else).

  See also COMMUNICATE, GOSSIP, SAY, SOCIAL.
~

-1 ENVENOM~
ENVENOM
Syntax: envenom <object>

The envenom skill is a cowardly skill practiced only by thieves, designed to
win a battle through alchemy and treachery rather than skill or strength.
Or, put another way, it's a skill used by the smart to kill the foolish.
Food, drink, and weapons may be envenomed, with varying effects. Poisoned
food or drink puts a mild poison spell on the consumer, and is unlikely to
be more than a minor inconvience (after all, the typical adventurer could
drink sewer water with only a trace of the runs).  A poisoned weapon, on
the other hand, can inflict serious damage on an opponent as the poison
burns through his bloodstream.  But be careful, blade venom evaporates
quickly and is rendered almost powerless by repeated blows in combat.

For exits, type the direction (north/s/e/w) followed by:

dig <vnum>         - creates the room and makes a two way link
link <room vnum>   - make a two way link
room <room vnum>   - make a one way link (use with caution)
key <object vnum>  - makes specified object the vnum of the key required
name <door name>   - makes the door's name/keywords = to the given name
desc               - edit the description of the exit
delete             - delete this exit
<exit-flags>       - type ? EXIT for a list(make exit door, locked etc.)

The exit flags are presented in the following manner.  The capitalized
flags are ones not included in the reset info.  i.e. closed is due to
a player closing the door and not due to the door being set to be closed.

-South to [ 3744] Key: [   -1] Exit flags: [door CLOSED bashed pickproof]

You can use the 'bump' technique to find hidden exits.  (Try to walk in a
certain direction and see what you bump into).

  See also LOOK, PROMPT, SCAN.
~

0 EXPERIENCE LEVEL XP~
EXPERIENCE, LEVEL

Your character advances in power by gaining experience.  You need a set
amount of experience points for each level based on your creation points.

You gain experience by:
    being part of a group that kills a monster
You lose experience by:
    fleeing from combat
    recalling out of combat
    being the target of certain spells
    dying

The experience you get from a kill depends on several things: how many players
are in your group; your level versus the level of the monster; your alignment
versus the monster's alignment; how many of this monster have been killed
lately; and some random variation.

56 FLAG~
FLAG
Syntax:
flag mob  <name> <field> <flags>
flag char <name> <field> <flags>
mob  flags: act,aff,off,imm,res,vuln,form,part
char flags: plr,comm,aff,imm,res,vuln,
+: add flag, -: remove flag, = set equal to
otherwise flag toggles the flags listed.


Flag allows you to change one of the following things about a mob their
act, aff, off, imm, res, vuln,form, or part flags or if used on a player
thier plr, comm, aff, imm, res, or vuln flags

this command should be seldom used on any players as the abuse potential
can be easily sumised. 

Flag alone will list your options.
 
  See also WIZHELP.
~

0 FLEE~
FLEE, RESCUE
Syntax: flee
Syntax: rescue   <character>

Once you start a fight, you can't just walk away from it.  If the fight
is not going well, you can attempt to FLEE, or another character can
RESCUE you.  (You can also RECALL, but this is less likely to work,
and costs more experience points, then fleeing).

If you lose your link during a fight, then your character will keep
fighting, and will attempt to RECALL from time to time.  Your chances
of making the recall are reduced, and you will lose much more experience.

RESCUE is a skill used when attempting to protect another player
in combat.  When successful, this skill will cause you to bare the
brunt of the attack formerly aimed at the player you rescued.

  See also DEATH, KILL, MORGUE, RECALL, SURRENDER.
~

0 FOLLOW NOFOLLOW~
FOLLOW, NOFOLLOW

Syntax: follow <character>
Syntax: nofollow
 
FOLLOW begins you following another character.  To stop following another
player, just type FOLLOW <yourself>.  To be grouped within another player's
party, you must first follow them.
 
NOFOLLOW allows you to toggle whether or not others may follow you.  To
check your current status, use the AUTO command.  To toggle your status,
merely enter NOFOLLOW without an argument.
 
   See also: AUTO, GROUP.
~

53 FORCE~
FORCE
Syntax: force <character> <command>
Syntax: force all <command>

FORCE forces one character to execute a command, with the exception of
the delete command.

Below level 57 force can only be used on mobiles, and force 
all is unavailable.  immortals below level 57 also  cannot 
'force crow murder/kill hugo', for example.

FORCE 'all' forces all player characters to execute a command.
This is typically used for 'force all save'.

  See also WIZHELP.
~

57 FREEZE~
FREEZE
Syntax: freeze <name>

FREEZE <character> is a toggle which prevents a character from issuing any
commands at all. It can be removed from within the game, so freezing a
troublemaker is usually a better option than they deny command.
 
  See also WIZHELP.
~

-1 GAIN~
GAIN

The gain command is used to learn new skills, once the proper trainer has
been found. (Check Caemlyn) The following options can be used with gain:

gain list:    list all groups and skills that can be learned
gain points:  lower your creation points by 1 (costs two sessions)
*This option will reset the amount of experience needed to next level.
gain <name>:  add a skill or skill group, at the listed cost
gain convert: turns 10 practices into one training session
gain practice: turns 1 training session into 10 practices

Gain uses training sessions, not practices. (see 'help train')
Gained skills and groups do NOT increase your experience per level or total
number of creation points.
~

-1 GATE~
GATE
Syntax: gate <target>

The gate spell is a powerful transportation magic that opens up a portal
between your character and another person or creature somewhere else in the
world.  This portal will transport you and any pet you might have, but not
other members of your group.  Monsters recieve a save against gate, and
monster or players more than 3 levels higher than you can not be gated to at
all.  God rooms, private rooms, and no recall rooms cannot be gated to, and
no recall rooms cannot be gated out of.  Finally, any god or hero is also
immune to gate, as well as in player who has no summon set.  Guild members
may not be gated to except by their fellow guild members.
~

-1 GHEALDAN, JEHANNAH~
GHEALDAN, JEHANNAHNA

Ghealdan is a small nation which lies between Amadicia and Altara.  Until
recently, it was a rather peaceful nation, possessing stable rule,
sufficient trade, and numerous towns and villages.  That all changed,
however, when the so-called Prophet of the Dragon Reborn decided to make
Ghealdan his home.  Four different rulers have taken power and died within
the last half year, with only Alliandre Maritha Kigarin holding the throne
by means of allowing the Prophet to remain in Ghealdan, and making no move
to push him out.  Riots are common in Ghealdan these days, mostly due to
crowds of Dragonsworn attacking those they feel do not show enough respect
to either the Prophet or the Dragon Reborn.

Jehannah, the capital city of Ghealdan, is a small city, possessing many
two- and three-story houses, but few palaces.  Numerous shops dot the
streets, and Alliandre rules from the Jheda Palace, trying to balance the
Prophet and a possible invasion from neighboring Amadicia.

The sigil of Ghealdan depicts three silver stars arranged one above and two
below.  The banner shows the Silver Stars on a field of red.  The current
ruler of Ghealdan is Alliandre Maritha Kigarin.

0 GLEEMEN GLEEMAN~
GLEEMEN

Entertainers that travel in trademark patchwork cloaks, gleemen are known
known widely as top-quality performers. Playing instruments, telling stories,
and doing stunts make up this entertainer's life. The highest quality of
these are taken sometimes as court bards for kings and queens themselves.
Most usually travel from city to city and village to village, getting their
pay from the audiences' donations.
~

-1 GOLD SILVER MONEY~
GOLD, SILVER, MONEY

The Wheel of Time economy is based on gold and silver coinage (and the lowly
copper, which you as an adventurer are far too proud to carry).  Gold coins
are worth 100 silver coins, but are also four times as heavy (25 to the
pound, as opposed to 100 to the pound for silver). Gems can be bought to
alleviate weight problems from jewellers, they charge a mere 10%
more than they are worth. 10 gems weigh one pound, and they can be worth
more than 100 gold pieces for the highest quality stones.  

See also BANK, WORTH, SCORE
~

0 GOSSIP~
Syntax: gossip <message>
 
GOSSIP is unlike the gossip lines found on most DIKU muds, on the WoT stock,
it is more of a rumor mill.  Rumor spreads on faster wings than fact, and
is often anonymous.  When spreading your message through the lands, it will
appear as such:

gossip the Children of the Light have invaded Murandy!
Rumor sweeps across the land: the Children of the Light have invaded Murandy!
 
Be weary, although anonymous, spreading rumors can have great impact upon
role-play.  There are even some guilds that can trace the rumor to its 
source!  So just like in life- be careful what you say and who you say it
to.

~

52 GOTO VIOLATE~
GOTO
Syntax: goto <location>

Goto takes you to a location.  The location may be specified as a vnum,
as the name of a mobile/player, or as the name of an object.

You may not Goto a room if it is PRIVATE and has two (or more) characters
already present, or if it is SOLITARY and has one (or more) characters
already present. Some other rooms are barred to players below a certain
god level.

Implementors can use the violate command to get into private rooms.

~

0 GREET~
Syntax: greet <character>

A somewhat disorienting function for any mud, players log in with access to
only Immortals names on the Who list.  Other players will be listed by their
nationality, and it is up to the players to make their own acquaintances
through roleplay.  Once roleplay is initiated, you may 'greet <character>'
and from that point on, they will have access to your name on their Who
list.  Remember, if someone greets you, you do not automatically greet them
in return.

GROUP
Syntax: group
Syntax: group <character>

GROUP <character> makes someone who is following you a member of your group.
Group members share experience points from kills and may use the GTELL and
SPLIT commands.  If anyone in your group is attacked, you will automatically
join the fight.

If the <character> is already a member of your group, then GROUP will
kick out the <character> from your group.  Characters can also leave your
group by using a FOLLOW command to stop following you.

GROUP with no argument shows statistics for each character in your group.

You may FOLLOW and GROUP only with characters who are within five levels of
your own.

0 GUARDCRUSH~
The most skilled warriors rely heavily upon their armor and parrying
ability to keep them from harm.  Masters of the quarterstaff and the blades
use their weapons in both offensive and defensive means.  Through
overbearing combat techniques and the fury of their attack, those practiced
in the wielding of heavy two-handed weapons can crush their opponent's
defense and lay them to waste.  Those with the guardcrush skill will find
themselves able to hack through an opponent's parry or shield block and
score an impressive hit.  
 
This is a group specific skill: Sam'dain.

-1 GUILD_AIEL AIEL_GUILD~
`yAiel`w

1) An appropriate description: A desc of at least four lines is required and
should not feature any statements of action.  This means things like "<Name>
watches you warily," etc.  Descs should only feature physical attributes
that can be seen by anyone.  How they react or what you might be doing at
the time should be left for actual rp.  

2) A personal profile/background/rp plan: What I'm looking for here is a
sense of who your character is and how they'll react to stimuli.  What are
their goals?  Do they have any quirks?  A word of advice: everyone wants to
rp the toughest fighter and the most respected and unique individual in the
world.  Most Aiel -will- be warriors, but you'll need to dig deeper than
their profession if you want to be guilded.  I want the personal details
that make this character tick.  I'm looking to build a guild with real human
beings.  Supermen and earthbound gods need not apply.  Oh, and try to give
some thought to who your parents were.  Players have a tendency to have
either dead parents or parents who were 'great warriors'.  Not gonna happen,
people.  Parents and family can provide some of the greatest rp
opportunities, so make them interesting and unique.  

3) Aiel nationality: This one's pretty obvious.  I'm not going to be
guilding any Sea Folk or Ogier and handing them a shoufa and veil.  Make
sure you're human and of Three-Fold Land descent.  

4) An extensive knowledge and rp test: This is just what it sounds like.  In
the beginning I'll be giving these tests myself.  It's my intent to make the
Aiel guild an example for the rest of the mud when it comes to rp, and in
order for that to happen I need to know that you can play an Aiel.  Aiel are
one of the most difficult races to play due to their specific cultural
practices and their sense of honor.  For the most part Aiel determined for
themselves when toh was owed and how much was required, so it is absolutely
vital I fill this guild with people who not only understand ji'e'toh
thoroughly, but are mature and responsible enough to accept the consequences
for their actions.  

5) An understanding that all things are ic: This is the tough one, and it's
because of this that I expect few members in the beginning.  Everything from
eq to levelling will be considered ic.  What this means is that no guilded
Aiel will ever be seen killing children in Caemlyn while wearing fish scales
for armor and wielding a sword from horseback.  All activity by Aiel will
take place in the Three-Fold Land and nowhere else until we reach a later
stage in the books.  The main problem with this is that t he 3FL is
incredibly small at the moment and ill-suited for levelling.  I'd considered
allowing guild members to level oocly in the wetlands, but I decided that
doing such would only endorse bad habits that I'd have to correct later. 
This does not mean that you cannot level at all if you're Aiel.  It just
means that once you're guilded you won't be allowed in the wetlands.  My
suggestion is that if you really want a guilded Aiel char for sanctioned rp,
you make an alt specifically for that purpose.  Any guilded Aiel found
levelling in the; wetlands or wearing wetlander eq wil l be removed from the
guild and stripped of all guild eq and skills.

Continued from HELP AIEL_GUILD

6) An agreement to follow rules and directions set by the guild leader (me,
Amys): It's my intent to make the Aiel guild set the example for rp and
maturity on the mud.  Our main purpose is to add realism and excellent
roleplaying to the mix in a hope that such will spread beyond the confines
of the Three-Fold Land.  I am not building a race of pkers, though pk will
eventually come up.  Anyone who made an Aiel char just to be tough should
not expect to be guilded.  Further, if any Aiel's actions have a negative
affect on the Aiel as a whole, they should expect to be hunted and
perm-killed.  (Yes, permanent death is a possibility in pk).  This does not
mean you can't have an individual personality.  It just means that no Aiel,
whether guilded or not, is going to be allowed to destroy the ic atmosphere
we're trying to establish on this mud.  If you go around pk'ing gai'shain,
expect to be dealt with severely.  

7) No male channelers of any kind: That's right, no MC's.  Any Aiel male
channeler would have only one line of rp, and that would be marching to the
Blight to fight Sightblinder.  Since this limits the lifespan of mc's, I see
no reason to waste time guilding them.  Furthermore, if you are a male
channeler and are seen channeling, expect Bad Things(tm) to come your way
from the collected warrior societies, none of whom like seeing their people
needlessly endangered by any channeling man other than He Who Comes With The
Dawn.  (which ain't you) 

8) Appropriate class rp: Warriors and Channelers make the best choices,
though obviously Channelers will only be guilded if female.  Thieves will be
accepted, but only if rp'd properly.  Stealing and spying were considered
huge toh by the Aiel, so some of your skills will get you in -serious-
trouble if used.  Be sure you're ready for ic punishment or prepared to
sacrifice some skills if that's the direction you choose to go.  

9) Additional: Be aware that all of these harsh requirements and
restrictions have been put into place in order to create as pure an rp
environment as possible.  Also know that once you gain admittance, you'll be
one of a select few and will have the right to be proud of your
accomplishment.  All members can expect the respect and support of their
guild leader, as well as planned rp sessions (once numbers reach the point
where such is possible).

0 GUILD_AREAS~
Guild areas are those areas specifically designed for roleplay purposes. 
As such, ALL actions within a Guild Area are considered IC.  There is no OOC
levelling in a designated Guild Area.  If you are in a designated guild area
without proper reasoning or levelling OOC, you must be prepared to defend
yourself against the IC repurcussions.  This may entail being rp'd violently
by the members of that guild, being attacked by them, harassment by imms, or
even a confrontation with an imm switched into an IC mob attempting to
invite you to leave.

-1 GUILD_ASHA'MAN~
`RA`Ys`Nha'm`Ya`Rn`w

The Asha'man "Defender" in the old tongue, is an army whose foundation was
set by Rand al'Thor, the Dragon Reborn, when he announced amnesty for any
male who could channel or wished to learn.  The call went out, and a
surprising number of men answered.  Whether they come to flee the
persecution of the outside world, to find mastery over their tainted
ability, or to find peace among others of their kind, they now serve the
Dragon Reborn as his army against the shadow, and the coming Tarmon Gaidon. 
With the help of His M'hael, Mazrim Taim, Rand created a system which
mirrored the White Tower for his newly proclaimed Asha'man.  Men begin their
training as "Soldiers."  After they have reached an acceptable level of
mastery, a Soldier is promoted to "Dedicated."  Only after he has proven
himself as a reliable channeler does one become promoted to "Asha'man." 
Unlike the White Tower, men are taught to use their abilities to kill, for
they are to be weapons against the dark times to come In addition, Asha'man
are typically rushed through their training as quickly as possible, and this
has caused more then one of them to burn out or worse.  Only the strong
survive in this army.  Do you have what it takes?  

There are a varied number of requirements, listed below, which need to be
met in order to join the Asha'man, in addition to the normal guild
requirements.  

1.  The Black Tower only accepts males into their fold.  The reasons for
this are obvious 

2.  As the male half of the one power, Saidin, has long been tainted by the
Dark One, every male channeler who wishes to join the Asha'man must have an
idea of his characters insanity.  The onset can be as gradual or expedient
as you like, but generally the higher level your character becomes, the more
erratic, irrational, and unstable he will become.  This is an important
requirement as it pertains to the high level of RP ability expected of any
who wish to join with the black tower.  

3.  Advancement is in the Asha'man is based almost exclusively upon RP. 
This requires a certain knowledge of the WOT world, its concepts, and its
history, especially as it pertains to The Dragon, the One Power, and male
channelers 

4.  Pk will often be a requirement in the Asha'man.  There is no room for
mercy in the Dragons Army.  You must be willing to die, and be willing to
take commands.  We are not a lose confederation of free-willed male
channelers, we are an army, and as in any army, those who do not follow
orders will be punished.  Those who blatantly defy them will be dealt with
in a swift and brutal manner.  

Those who wish to join the Asha'man should post a note to "Mazrim," and post
their backgrounds on the History board with "Asha'man" somewhere in the
title.  Background story requirements are strict, and you may be asked to
revise/rewrite if your background does not meet standards.

-1 GUILD_COMPANIONS~
`GCo`Ymp`Nan`Yio`Gns`w

The Illianer Companions are an Elite mounted military formation.  It is the
Companions duty to provide themselves as bodyguards for the King of IllIan,
as well as protecting key points in our nation.  Additionally in battle we
assault the enemy's strongest positions exploiting their weaknesses and if
the need may arise covering the retreat of our King.  The Companions ranks
are filled from all the Nations of our World excluding those from the
nations of Tear, Lugard and Altara.  As of now the Companions are open and
in need of members, those interested see the requirements below: 

1.  You must be either a Rogue or a warrior, as usual no channelers will be
allowed into the guild.  For this warrior is preferred 

2.  There are certain skills that are required for the guild: Sword: This is
our primary weapon and is a must for all members Riding: Because we are a
mounted unit you will need to know how to ride even though a horse will be
provided.  Rescue/Guard: We protect the king and with these skills we can do
this.  

3.  Due to our relations with other nations, you cannot be Tairen, Murandian
or Altaran.  All other nations are welcome and have the right to gain even
the highest ranks in the guild.  

4.  RP: role-playing is an absolute must in the Companions.  You must be
able to role play your enterance and reasons for joining the Companions for
those wishing to join the Officer Corps then RP is essential.  

5.  PK will be allowed in the Companions only as a last resort in the
defense of your life, the life of another Companion or the life of an
innocent.  RP must be done before PK.  I will not tolerate people just
walking into a room and attacking somebody else, accounts of this will be
punished IC with extra chores and pay deductions.

-1 GUILD_GAIDIN~
`BG`ba`Nid`bi`Bn`w

Gaidin is old tongue for "Brother to Battle".  It is we who serve, protect,
and (in private, when asked) offer council to the Sedai.  While not all who
come to the Yard seek to become a Warder, anyone training under our tutelage
is expected to serve when needed.  Those who seek training merely to advance
their own skills will be allowed, but should not expect advancement past
Towerguard.  Since you will not be allowed to keep your guild eq if you
leave, nor will you benefit from any skill at that rank, your decision to RP
this is up to you.  

1) No females are allowed in the guild (help ARCHETYPE).  This guild is not
open to Ogier, Seanchan, Aiel, or Aryth backgrounds 

2) This guild is not open to Channelers.  The Wheel weaves as the Wheel
wills, and it generally weaves male channelers FAR away from the White
Tower.  

3) Your character must be a Warrior or Rogue, and must be put together to
survive armed conflict.  This will get you in the guild.  If you wish to
advance in rank towards serving as a Warder, then the following skills are
required: Rescue, Sneak, and Fast Healing.  The following combat groups fall
just short of being requirements and are HIGHLY suggested: Manshimai,
Blademaster, Assassin, or Sam'dain.  

4) RP RP RP RP.  Students and Towerguard may rp as they wish, but those
attaining higher ranks MUST REALIZE that Warders always play second to their
Sedai.  Gaidin are background characters- they are NOT Superman, they are
more akin to Batman.  While rp between Warder and Sedai may indeed be
intense, but to the casual observer, Warders are nothing but really mean
lapdogs.  

5) Quill a history on the HISTORY board.  It may be to all or Gaidin. 
Explain where you are from and why you wish to join Gaidin.  Know your
history, you will be tested on it through rp sessions with the guild imms. 
If you claim you have killed many a Fade in your history, you better be
prepared to face a Fade in your testing.  Level 15's who rp heroes of great
reknown do not go over well in this guild.  

If you wish to either join the Gaidin, or are just interested, contact 'Croi
Makin' or 'Hammar' by either note or tell.

-1 GUILD_GLEEMEN~
`YG`Rl`We`Ce`Mm`Be`Gn`w

Gleemen are men and women who travel the world, earning their living by
entertaining people for money, food, or shelter for the night.  They are a
mixed lot with different backgrounds, characteristics and nationalities.  A
gleeman must be skilled in many disciplines in order to adjust his
performances to suit the different kinds of audiences, though he or she may
still, and often are, specialised in one form of entertainment.  The
disciplines range from fire-eating and acrobatics, to storytelling and
painting.  You name it!  

The Gleemen guild which is lead by Master Gleeman Thom Merrilin, rely
heavily on RP (Roleplay).  This doesn't mean you have to be an elite RPer to
join, but you are expected to enjoy it, and have a desire to develop your
ability.  Performances and good RP will be rewarded richly.  

These are the requirements you have to fulfill if you wish to join the
guild: 

1.  Rogues and warriors are welcome, though rogue is preferred.  No
channelers.  

2.  All nationalities are allowed, except Ogier, Aiel and Seanchan.  Seafolk
may be guilded but will be required to have a good IC (In Character) reason
for it.  

3.  Finally the most important req...  You must be IC a certain amount of
your time online.  I will not tolerate people who spend their entire time on
the mud having OOC (Out Of Character) in their title or rdesc.  This doesn't
mean that you're not allowed to level, but it does mean that you will
interact ICly with your fellow guild members and other players as soon as
opportunity arises.  

If you have any questions about the reqs or the guild in general, feel free
to speak with Thom online or note him: 'Thom Merrilin'.

-1 GUILD_HAILENE~
`gH`Na`Wile`Nn`ge`w 

The Hailene, "Those Who Come Before", seek to make way for the Corenne, the
return of an Empire forged long ago by Luthair Paendrag, the son of Artur
Hawkwing.  However, much has changed since Hawkwing's time.  The oaths sworn
so long ago have been long forgotten by the various peoples the Seanchan set
sail towards.  If the Seanchan find the land lacking in the old ways, as
they will, then the land is to be conquered and culled.  The power of the
Seanchan is great as they utilize monstrous beasts and women who can channel
are controlled by the collar-like ter'angreal, the a'dam.  Men and women on
five hundred ships have set sail from the far off land of the Seanchan to
take back what is rightfully theirs.  

There are a number of requirements, listed below, that need to be met in
addition to the normal guild requirements.  

1.  Men and women on five hundred ships have set sail from the far off land
of the Seanchan to take back what is rightfully theirs.  The Hailene
invasion force is comprised of many varying elements, which consist of
trained soldiers, exotic beast handlers, Sul'dam, and Damane.  (Warriors and
combat-orientated rogues may join as soldiers or exotic handlers.  Female
channelers or warrior/rogue channelers may join as either Sul'dam or
Damane.)  

2.  As the Hailene conquer, they add men of other nations to their army. 
Though the Hailene are comprised of Seanchan nationality, others will be
accepted with the exclusion of the Aiel and Ogier.  However, they are
limited to the rank of recruits for that is what they are.  

3.  Their beasts fight with both tooth and claw, but the Seanchan themselves
wield swords and spears.  Being able to wield one of these two weapons is
essential.  

4.  A general knowledge of the WoT is necessary, and even more needed is at
least a rudimentary knowledge of the Seanchan.  This is something that will
be tested until it is learned.  The more someone knows of them, the better
someone may RP one.  RP aids in being promoted, especially to the highest
positions within the guild.  

If anyone wishes to be known for one of the Hailene send a note to 'Turak'
and the guild 'Hailene' and someone will be with you as soon as possible.

-1 GUILD_QUEENSGUARD~
`RQue`Wen's Gu`Rard`w 

For as many years as there has been a Queen of Andor there has been the
Queen's Guard.  Over it's long history the Queen's Guard has earned the
admiration and respect of both friend and foe in their tireless defense of
Queen and Realm.  All Andorans of strong character and will and of
unquestioned loyatly to the Throne of Andor are welcome in the Queen's
Guard.  It is a hard life and times, but always a very rewarding.  

1.  Seek the enemy.  It's hard to defend the Queen and the Realm if you
can't find your foe.  The 'hunt' skill is highly recomended but not strictly
required.  

2.  Only andorans are welcomed into the Queen's Guard without some proof of
their loyalty.  If you are not from Andor and want to join talk to Gareth
Bryne and he will have tasks for you to complete in order to prove your
loyalty to the Queen.  

3.  Since Role Playing is a large part of this MUD, and a huge part of
getting promoted in the Queen's Guard you are required to have some basic
knowledge of the WOT books.  In all honesty if you haven't read at least 3
of the books then you will have some trouble with the world here.  

4.  You must be a rather good person.  Background checks will be performed
and any criminals (IE: - alignment) will be arrested on sight for
questioning.  

If you have any questions or comments or applications please drop 'Gareth
Bryne' and 'Queen's Guard' on the personal board and it will be replied to
post haste.

-1 GUILD_SEI'CAIR~
`NS`Ye`Ni'C`Yai`Nr`w

In a time long before the age of legends, a time forgotten in the spinning
and reweaving of the Wheel of Time there was a point in history where people
roamed the woods and forests with their canine counterparts...  The wolves. 
These people where colloquially referred to as wolfbrothers.  They had the
unique ability to converse with wolves, even over great distances.  Much is
lost on this ability, but what little is know, and the few people who do
know would recognize the distinctive golden colored eyes, much like the
wolves they associate with.  Many ages have passed, and with their passage
the ability to commune with the wolves has slipped away, nearly forgotten. 
Only recently has this ability started reappearing in individuals.  It is
uncertain as to why or the extent it may reach, but one fact remains with a
certainty- wolves are known for their deep-rooted hatred for Shadowspawn and
anything relating to the Dark One.  In a time so close to Tarmon Gaidon, the
Last Battle, it leaves little open to speculation.  

Entry into the Sei'Cair is simple.  First and foremost: one must show a
strong desire to role play a character whose mind is slowly, but inevitably,
merging with the collective thought of the wolves.  Knowledge of the wolfkin
is not required but recommended, and having read the first book in the Wheel
of Time series is highly recommended.  

Any nationality is accepted in the guild except those of Seanchan and Ogier.

Any channelers applying, both male and female, will be directed to the
various channeling guilds.  

While Aiel will be permitted, being Sei'Cair will be especially difficult
for them.  They must have an excellent RP reason for being out of the Three
Fold Land including a detailed story that explains how they came about their
ability and when and where they heard about myself and decided to seek me
out.  

Please direct all inquiries to Elyas Machera (Elyas for posting purposes),
or Sierra, the Sei'Cair mortal guild leader.

-1 GUILD_THIEFTAKER~
`yThi`NefTa`yker`w

It taked dedication to surive life where the world is full of injustice and
trickery.  The Thieftakers are here to stop it.  We are a group of
mercenaries that track those that have deceived or caused injustice for a
price.  Throughout the many lands, we roam as we take on jobs and complete
them with no place to stay but tents as we try to make the world better
maybe even safer.  We live by a simple Motto, JUSTICE will always prevail in
the END!.  

To be accepted as a Thieftaker, certain requirements must be met:

1.  One should have the power of a warrior or the cunning of a thief.  If
one has the ability to touch the One Power, then you shall not find a haven
among the group as our reputation allows us to survive.  

2.  As there are better groups for some cultures, Aiel, Ogier, Seafolk, and
Seanchan shall not be members of the group.  

3.  Whether you follow the Lord of the Dark or the Creator is of no concern.

4.  Survival in this job, requires knowledge of the lands and thier customs.
RP is enforced at all times, your actions shall be watched as the reputation
that you build affects all the members.  The success of your jobs will help
you rise in the ranks.  

If you know that you have what it takes or believe that this is the job you
have dreamed for, contact 'Juilin' by note or in person.  I can be found at
Old Mother Grubb's or the Thieftaker's Hall in Tear.

-1 Guild_Hunter~
`gH`Gu`gnt`Ge`gr`w

The Hunt has been called again, and word spreads forth from Illian to all
nations.  The Horn of Valere is somewhere out in the world, and needs to be
brought to the Light for Tarmon Gai'don.  Any who feel that they have the
will and ability to bear such a weight, along with the honor and glory the
Hunt brings are welcome to apply.  The Hunt is open to all whom seek a life
of excitement and glory, where the quest for the greatest of treasures pulls
you deep into danger and intrigue.  

Certain requirements are to be met, as you can see listed below.  Other than
the normal Guild requirements, these traits are highly sought after in
Hunters: 

1.  Gain knowledge of that which we seek - Those who are able to actively
hunt for the Horn will be welcomed to our band, although all are needed if
we are to beat the Shadow to the prize.  (Hunt and butcher skills are good
to have, but not absolutely necessary.)  

2.  Given that there are other, more important facets to their cultures,
Aielmen, Ogier, Seafolk and Seanchan will not take part in the Hunt. 
Channelers will also be pointed to other leaders, although channelers are
not strictly forbidden.  

3.  A decent knowledge of the WoT World, as RP is encouraged at all times,
if not with other Guild members, then with anyone you encounter on your
journeys.  Guild advancement is assisted by good RP, although those who gain
experience will always be watched.  

4.  One last thing..  Your alignment is of no concern to us.  You can be
good or evil, I don't need to know at all.  Many join the Hunt with
intentions known only to themselves.  

If you wish to join the Hunt, or if you have any questions, please send a
quick note to myself 'Patrik' or 'Dewar', and the Hunter guild 'Hunter', and
you will be visited by one or both of us soon afterwards.

-1 Guild_Join~
Guild_Join

This file will give you the basic requirements to join any of the Guilds
here on Tarmon Gai'don.  

1.  You must be at least 15th level.  No exceptions.  

2.  You will need to have a character description written.  Helpful hint: Do
not make descriptions that invoke actions in another character.  Ie The tall
Saldaen's eyes send fear coursing through your veins.  Describe your
character, think of it as trying to tell a blind person how
something/someone looks.  

3.  You will need to post a history/story about yourself on the HISTORY note
board.  This can be anything to autobiography to a simple tale of a
adventure you have had.  When posting your history make sure you post it to
the Guild your are interested in and the name of the Guild's Immortal.  

4.  We live and die by RP on this MUD, therefore certain restrictions apply
concerning what types of characters can join a ceratin guild.  Read the
HELP_ARCHETYPE file to see a comprehensive list of do's and dont's.  

5.  Most Guilds will have specific additional requirements for prospective
Guildies.  Each guild has it's own help file, Guild_Aiel, Guild_Gaidin, etc.

Immortals on Tarmon Gai'don, feel free to contact them with any questions
you may have about joining their guild.

-1 HAGGLE HAGGLING~
HAGGLE
Syntax: haggle

Haggling is an indispensable skill to the trader.  It allows a character to
match wits with a merchant, seeking to get a better price for merchandise,
or to buy at the lowest possible cost.  Unfortunately, most merchants are
already very skilled at haggling, so the untrainined adventurer had best
guard his treasure closely.  Thieves are natural masters at haggling,
although other classes may learn it as well.

   130% or above.  These rates should be rare and extremely discouraged.

   approved by Council and have VERY good rationale.

-1 HIDE SNEAK~
Hide and sneak are similar skills, both related to remaining undetected.
Hide has a very high chance of success, but only works for as long as the
character remains stationary.  Sneak may be used when moving (including to
sneak by monsters), but has a lower chance of success.  Only warriors and
thieves may learn these skills.

Syntax: wear   <object>
Syntax: wear   all
Syntax: wield  <object>

Three of these commands will take an object from your inventory and start using
it as equipment.  HOLD is for light sources, wands, and staves.  WEAR is for
armor.  WIELD is for weapons.

WEAR ALL will attempt to HOLD, WEAR, or WIELD each suitable item in your
inventory.

You may not be able to HOLD, WEAR, or WIELD an item if its alignment does not
match yours, if it is too heavy for you, or if you are not experienced enough
to use it properly.

REMOVE will take any object from your equipment and put it back into your
inventory.

52 HOLYLIGHT INVIS WIZINVIS~
Syntax: holylight
	wiznvis <level>

Holylight is a toggle that allows you to see (almost) every character and
mobile in the game.  With holy light, you can see what's in the game more
easily.  Without holy light, you can see what mortal players see.

Wizinvis takes a level argument, and will mke you invisible to all players of
a lower level than your invisibility level.  It defaults to the maximum
(your level) if no argument is given.  Wizi 60 characters are totally
invisible.

-1 HUMANS~
Humans are the most populous of the races, and make up the majority of
adventurers.  Although they do not possess any of the special talents of
Ogier or Myrddraal, they are more versatile, being skilled in all four
classes.  A small percentage of humans possess the ability to channel, being
the only race which can do so.  Humans may also train their primary stat
higher than any other race, and are able to gain more benefit from magical
devices.

Humans, unlike other races, vary widely from one country to another in
skills, appearance, customs, accents, and garb.  For more information, refer
to HELP COUNTRIES.

  See also OGIER, MYRDDRAAL, TROLLOCS, CHANNELING, COUNTRIES.
~

0 HUNT~
People with knowledge in tracking are able to find something, wether a
footprint or a break of a twig that can lead them to their prey, the better
you are at hunting the more precise you will be in it.  
~

0 IC 'IN CHARACTER'~
IC stands for In Character, and is a way of being. In Robert Jordan's world,
people and things acted quite a bit differently than we do today. When you
are acting according to his world and not our own, that is considered "being
IC".
For example:
If you say "Greetings, how do you fare today?", that is usually IC.
If you say "Hey, wazzup?", that is OOC.

In this MUD, WoT: Tarmon Gai'don, characters are expected to be IC as
often as possible.  While we understand the need to level is integral to
character growth, certain concessions must be made.  If levelling, or
doing anything Out of Character, you MUST put OOC in your title or rdesc
or else your actions are open to IC interpretation and consequences.
Exceptions to this rule can be found under help Guild_Areas.
 
See also OOC, WHEEL OF TIME, RP, RDESC, GUILD_AREAS, IC_CHANNELING
~

0 IC_CHANNELING~
To keep a balance between the IC and the OOC demands of the mud, it is
important to prescribe WHAT and WHO discerns whether channeling is IC.  Most
of these rules can be found in various places on the mud, but they are laid
out here for simplicities sake.  
 
1) If you are involved in active RP and channel or emote that you channel,
you are responsible for this.
2) If you are leveling IC'ly and channel, you are responsible.
3) If you are leveling OOC'ly and channel, your channeling cannot be open
to IC interpretation (unless in a mandated IC ONLY area).
4) If you are an IC Sul'dam and channel, you must have something pertaining
to your damane in your rdesc or title.
5) If you are an IC Damane and channel, you must have something pertaining
to your sul'dam in your title, or suffer the IC consequences for being
unleashed.
6) If you are an IC Novice and channel, you had better the permission of an
Aes Sedai or Accepted, 'lest you find yourself sent to the Mistress of
Novices.
 
See also IC, GUILD_AREAS, RDESC.
~

56 IDLE~
Syntax: idle <character name/blank>

Idle by it's self shows a listing of every player on the mud and how many 
ticks since the last command was issued by that player. Idle with a
character name show the immortal the same information on that specific
player.
~

-1 ILLIAN~
Illian borders the two much smaller countries of Altara and Murandy.  During
the Whitecloak War, Illian assisted Altara in order to insure that Altara
remained a buffer zone between Illian and Amadicia.  Illian is a large
nation, and does much trade by sea, land, and river.  It is ruled by the
King, the Council of Nine, and the Assemblage.  Men in Illian wear long
coats with raised collars, and the current fashion is to wear beards which
leave the upper lip bare.  Women wear wide-brimmed hats held in place by
long scarves that are worn around the neck.  High ladies wear slippers
worked with silver and gold, and Lords wear boots fringed in these metals,
as well.

The city of Illian stands on a marsh at the edge of the Sea of Storms.
Illian needs no walls to keep out invaders, as the marsh effectively
prevents any land-borne invasion.  The marsh surrounding the city contains
many large tanneries on small islands, which produce the country's vast
output of finished leather.  From afar, the city appears to be made entirely
of palaces and towers, rising right out of the swamp.  Upon closer
inspection, however, one sees that the city is made up mostly of small
buildings.  The large Perfumed Quarter (so-called because of the odor of
hemp, pitch, and harbor air which permeates the air) surrounds the docks of
the city.  The port usually contains a multitude of fishing and trade ships,
and the docks are always bustling with activity.

The sigil of Illian consists of nine golden bees arranged in a diamond, from
top to bottom 1-2-3-2-1.  The banner depicts the Nine Golden Bees on a field
of dark green, which is fringed in gold if the sovereign is present.  The
current ruler is Mattin Stepaneos, whose standard is Three Leopards, silver
on black.  The current ruler is Rand al'Thor.

~

-1 ILLUMINATOR_GUILD~
There is a famous saying around Tanchico:

"The best secret to reveal
is the face behind a lady's veil,
the most deadly
is that of an Illuminator's Spark."

The Guild of Illuminators is based in Tanchico and lead by me, Paetar,
Master of `CI`b`Wl`Ml`Gu`Rm`Yi`Cn`Ga`bt`Wi`Ro`mn`ws.  

Our requirements are as follows: The following is `Cooc`w-

1) You must be level 15.  

2) An acceptable history has been written - i.e. it should include where you
were born, who introduced you to the Family, any relations you have, any
enemies, quirks (I want a lot of these they make for original chracters),
etc.  

3) Race/Class/Original Country: only Humans will be guilded, and if you're
Seanchan, the odds are you won't be guilded, unless you have an excellent rp
story to back it up.  

You must be willing to perform for the people (of course, you can charge the
Guild's standard price for these shows) and you must be willing to RP -
always.  No exceptions.  If you are consistently not RPing, this can and
will result in demotion and/or ostracism from the guild.  

If you are guilded, and you graduate your Apprenticeship, you must be
willing to take the Three Vows, and you must also be willing to protect our
secrets at any cost.  

Contact me with questions or concerns.  

Paetar, Master of `CI`b`Wl`Ml`Gu`Rm`Yi`Cn`Ga`bt`Wi`Ro`mn`ws.  

Look for the `CI`bl`Wl`Mu`Gm`Ri`Yn`Ca`Gt`bo`Rr`ws homepage soon...  It should have RP info, guild
reqs, etc.

-1 IMMORTAL IMMORT GOD WIZARD WIZ~
'Immortal' (often, simply, 'immort') refers to players who have reached
the highest attainable levels in the game.  Here, anyone of level 52
or higher is an 'immortal.'  Immortals are capable of exceeding the
usual game rules, in more drastic and pervasive ways as levels increase;
examples range from teleportation and invisibility to mortal sight to
creation of objects, removal of a player's privileges (channels,
ability to move, or even ability to log in), and ability to promote
players to immortality.

Since immortals can wreak havoc with game balance, they are (ideally)
a carefully-chosen and policed group.  An absolute rule of immortal
behavior is that no immortal can aid or assist any player without
explicit permission from the higher ranks; in other words, please
don't ask an immortal to help you kill a mob, gather EQ, etc, or
you'll likely be either politely or rudely refused, or referred to
this file.

The duties of immortals, and even the very reasons for their existence,
are topics of continual and heated debate in various MUD forums, and are
fraught with misconceptions, poor examples, and outrageous hypocrisies. :)
~

51 IMMTALK~
Syntax: immtalk <message>
	immtalk

Immtalk sends a message to all immortals.  : is a synonym for immtalk.
Using this command with no argument turns off the immortal channel (or
turns it back on).
~

-1 IMM_APPLICATION~
IMMORTAL APPLICATION

Tarmon Gaidon is always looking for a few good Imms.  If you are interested
in perhaps running a guild on the MUD, visit our website.  

The website is www.dharvest.com

After filling out the information there, you will be sent a detailed
secondary application.  After that is reviewed, you will be contacted with
the decision.  
 
Thank you.
~

51 IMM_RULES~
`RRules of Immortality`w

1.  Never use any of your powers to aid any mortals, including your own. 
Things such as transing them around, loading eq, channeling weaves on them,
weakening a mob for them, and so on.  

2.  Never kill or even attack a mort with your Imm.  Period.  

3.  Never contradict another Imm in public.  If you have a disagreement, do
it over Imm or seek out Council.  

4.  Do not punish mortals in guilds other than your own over Guild rules
violations.  Pass the info on to the morts GL and let them handle it.  The
only exception(s) are violations of MUD wide policies.  

5.  Renames are a part of ALL immortals duties.  

6.  Only Council can make MUD wide policy.  Period.  

7.  Color restrings are a special reward.  You may give them out only in
Quests or as rewards to your guildees for exceptional RP.  

8.  Read, learn and love the help QGEN file.  

9.  Do not chown no_remove no_drop eq from morts.  

10.  Never give out alt information on your fellow Imms.  That is no ones
business but their own.  

`R*`w Use common sense, if something seems bad...  It probaly is.  When in doubt
ask Council.  

`R*`w Your being a Imm is a privlege that can taken away at any time.  You are
not above the law.  In fact you are held to a higher standard than mortals
are.  

`R*`w Above all other rules.  Remember that its JUST a game.  Your egos have no
place here, only Council may have a ego.  Remember this rule and your life
as a Imm will be much easier.  
~

52 INCOGNITO~
Toggling your incognito status will hide your presence from people outside the
room you are in, but leave you visible to those who are with you.  It takes
a level argument similar to wizinvis, people at that level or higher can see
you regarless of location.
~

56 INVLIST~

Please speak to Phil or Gary if you have questions about specific positions.

~

-1 KANDOR, CHACHIN~
Kandor lies on the Blightborder between the nations of Arafel and Saldaea.
Like most nations along the Blight, Kandor possesses a strong military
tradition.  Although its close proximity with the Blight prevents it from
being a major trading center, its merchants have established a strong
reputation and have brought much wealth to Kandor.

Kandori men are easily recognized by their forked beards, and they generally
wear one to three silver chains across their chests.  Kandori also usually
wear an earring, and those of members of the Merchant's Guild can be quite
showy.

The current ruler of Kandor is Queen Ethenielle Cosaru Noramaga.  The sigil
of Kandor is a rearing red horse and the banner consists of a The Red Horse
on a field of pale green.  The capital city is Chachin.

~

-1 KICK~
KICK

Kicking allows the player to receive an extra attack of sorts in combat,
a powerful kick.  This attack is not without it's hazards though, as a
missed kick may throw the unwary fighter off balance.  Warriors are the most
proficient in the use of kicking, followed by rogues.  

Players with the hand to hand skill will gain a bonus towards their kick,
while Sovin'Dore are truly the skill's masters.  
~

0 KILL~
Syntax: kill <target>

KILL is the basic command used to initiate combat with a NPC (Mob) or
another player character.  Other commands may be used to initiate combat,
dependent upon the skills you may have chosen as a character.  Some
characters can blind an opponent with Dirt Kick to open combat, others
might channel a weave, while some may be able to backstab.
 
Killing Mobs is the primary way to advance the levels of your character.
Other ways include rp bonus' from immortals, but killing mobs is the most
expedient.  Before you attempt to kill a mob, it might be wise to first
CONSIDER it.
 
Killing players is known as PK, and certain rules have been set up to
create a fun environment for all to play.
 
  See also: CONSIDER, PK, DEATH
~

0 KNIVES~
A rogue chosing the Knives specialty is often a master at hand-eye
coordination, and uses this dexterity with deadly results.  It is not rare
to face such an opponent and find yourself not only on the defensive against
their quick and deadly melee, but against a barrage of missile weapons as
well.  Those with the Knives specialty will not only be quick to pull
another dagger from their sleeves when disarmed, but also to toss with
unerring accuracy.  
 
**THIS SPECIALTY HAS YET TO BE IMPLEMENTED!
~

-1 LAG~
Twas dial-up, and the failing mudders did toil and struggle in the fray
All checksummed were the compressed files
And the man pages, outdate
Beware the Internet my son,
The noise that hangs, the lag that kills
Beware the Usenet news, and shun the frivolous mud with frills
So took his his mudding client in hand
Longtime the virtual foe he sought
So rested he by the T1s three and paused a while in swap
And as in disk-drive swap he stayed,
The Internet, with lags of fame
Came packetwise through the T1 line
And error-checked as it came
One two one two and through and through, the mudding client went kill -9
He left it dead and with it's core he went a tracing back
And hath thou slain the Internet?
Come to my arms my disk-based bot!
Oh lag-free day, callooh callay, he chortled in his joy
Twas dial-up, and the failing mudders did toil and struggle in the fray
All checksummed were the compressed files
And the man pages, outdate.
~

56 LOAD~
Syntax: load mob <vnum>
	load obj <vnum>

The load command is used to load new objects or mobiles (use clone to
duplicate strung items and mobs).  The vnums can be found with the vnum of
vfind command, or by stat'ing an existing mob or object.

Load puts objects in inventory if they can be carried, otherwise they are
put in the room.  Mobiles are always put into the same room as the
immortal who loaded them. (see also clone, vfind, vnum, stat)
~

55 LOG~
LOG
Syntax: log   <character>
	log   all
	snoop <character>

Log <character> causes all of a character's commands to be logged into
the server's log file.  Like Freeze, it is a permanent character toggle.
Logs may only be used by creators and implementors, and should be accompanied
by mail to the implementors.

Certain commands (Password) are protected against log.  Conversely, certain
commands (especially immortal commands) are always logged.

Log all logs all character commands.  It is a server-wide toggle; it does not
persist across reboots. Please do not use this unless you tell the imps.

~

-1 LORE~
LORE Syntax: lore <object>

Lore is a general purpose skill that consists of knowledge of myths and
legends.  Use of the lore skill gives you a chance of obtaining detailed
information concerning the item in question.  Many items have several key
features, or scraps of knowledge, and checking a general lore skill on these
items may produce more detailed results the more often you attempt to
discern it's secrets.  

This is a group specific skill: Bard.
This is a Guild specific skill: Wansho.
~

-1 MAGIC_SYSTEM~
The magic system in use here on the WoT Mud attempts to closely
parrallel the magic system used in the world of the Wheel
of Time.  What exactly does this mean? Well, first off, this
means that 'channeling' is not only powerful, but also
dangerous to not only those around the channeler, but also
to the channeler himself.  It is entirely possible to
'burn yourself out' (ie: remove your ability to channel) or
even to kill yourself if you attempt to channel beyond your
strength or skill.
 
 
--work in progress--
~

51 MANADICE OP_DICE~
A high number of dice makes for less variance in mobiles ability.
The values the server generates for  mobs is

  <level> d 10 + 100

where level is the level of the mobile.
 
~

-1 MANSHIMAI~
Cost: Rogue (75) Warrior (60)

A proficiency in fighting dual-wielded practiced by rogues, the Manshimai
style of combat produces some of the deadliest (and underhanded) fighters. 
When dual-wielding, a player cannot use the Shield Block skill, and loses
two potential armor slots (Held and Shield).  Characters studying under this
group will gain the following skills (upon level requirements):

[0 ] dual wield
[1 ] third attack
[2 ] second attack
[3 ] bash
[4 ] parry
[5 ] dodge
[6 ] enhanced damage
[7 ] dagger
[8 ] sword
~

-1 MAP MAPS~
The world of the Wheel of Time is vast.  The continent that the story
takes place on has no proper name, and is commonly referred to as "Randland"
by fans of the series.
 
The general geography of this continent is known by most, so a basic
map of the known world has been created for players, showing major
cities and roads.  The map is devided into four sections; northwest,
northeast, southwest, and southeast.  To view the northwest section, type:
help NWmap
 
In the game, more specific maps of areas can be purchased from map makers.
 
The legend for all maps is as follows:
`yM`w - mountains   `b@`w - Water   `Y(1-9)`w - cities   `g^`w - grassland   `nx`w - blight
 
  See Also:
    NWmap, NEmap, SEmap, SWmap
~

-1 MAYENE~
Mayene is a small city-state which rests on a peninsula east of Tear.
Although it is an independent nation, Tear claims it as a province, despite
loud protests from Mayene.  The primary source of Mayene's wealth and what
little independence it possesses is the secret oilfish shoals.  The lamp oil
which is produced from oilfish rivals that produced from the olives grown by
Tear, Illian, and Tarabon.  No Tairen knows the secret location of the
oilfish shoals, and Mayene will kill to insure that none ever do.

The ruling family of Mayene claims descendence from Artur Hawkwing, and uses
the Paendrag name.  The current "First" of Mayene is Berelain sur Paendrag,
a young and beautiful ruler who is extremely capable in more than one
respect, and who acted as the regent of Cairhien for a short while.

The sigil of Mayene is a golden hawk in flight.  Its banner is a Golden Hawk
in flight on a field of blue.  Called Paendrag's Banner by Mayeners, it is
fringed in gold when the First is present.  The capital city is Mayene.

0 MENDING MEND~
From their time spent in mastering their weapons from forging to
training, players with the Mend skill will be able to spend time to repair
their damaged weapons and armor.  While weapons and armor can never be
brought back up to 100% once they have been damaged, it is possible through
the use of this skill to keep a heavily worn object in a good state of
repair.  There is a minor cost to the use of this skill, being 1 gold for
every point recovered to the object.  This skill can only be used on objects
of type Armor and Weapon, and not Clothing, Treasures, or anything others.  
 
This is a Group specific skill: Weaponsmaster

0 MILITARY MANEUVERS~
This skill is the verse of those trained in the art of organized warfare.
Military Maneuvers are only effective when a Campaigner is grouped with
another.  The more Campaigners grouped, the deadlier they become.  Trained
in the such maneuvers as flanking, shield walls, pincers, the hedgehog, and
feints, Campaigners can quickly dispatch of a group of opponents through use
of these tactics.  

This is a group specific skill: Campaigner.  

~

51 MLIST~
Syntax: mlist <all/mob name>

Mlist is a command within redit that allows you to view the vnums of
specified mobs. If the argument is all, then all of the mobs created in the
zone being edited will be displayed. If a keyword is used as an arguement,
any and all mobs within the zone being edited with a matching keyword will
be displayed. Name and vnum are listed in both displays.

0 MOB_AC~
The values ROM generates for a merc format mob is:

   level      pierce    bash    slash   exotic
     1          95       95       95      95

    80        -400     -400     -400    -150

These values are 10 times what you would put in an area file. This
is because the server multiplies what it reads from file with 10.

0 MOVEMENT~
A player can potentially move in any of six directions, these being:
north, south, east, west, up, and down.  The direction the player can move
is dependent upon the room exits available.  For a list of the player's
current room exits, simply type "exits".  

Movement from room to room detracts from a player's Endurance.  When
reaching 0 Endurance, the player will find themselves unable to move.  

Different terrains have different movement costs; cities might be quickly
crossed, while mountain ranges exact a harsher toll.  

Sometimes there may be a hidden exit from a room, as if found behind a
bookcase or some brambles.  These hidden exits are found through use of the
Search skill or by dumb luck.  
~

0 MSGS~
Syntax: msgs [hunger|weather]
 
The messages command allows you to toggle on or off the warning
messages pertaining to the weather or your hunger/thirst status.
 
Remember, wandering around hungry or thirsty has negative
consequences on your regeneration rates.
 
See also SCORE.
~

51 MSHOW~
Syntax: mshow <mob vnum>

This command, used within redt, allows you to view a certain mob's statistics
without actually leaving the editor. This does not, however, allow you to
edit the mob, simply view. The mob does not have to be in the zone being
edited.

See also: REDIT, MEDIT~

52 MUDSTATE~
Syntax: mudstate

Mudstate provides statistical information about a mud including
information about character creation and deletions. Deletion information 
shows deletions by both immortals and by the characters themselves.
Mudstate provides the information needed at a glance to gauge the pulse of 
your mud. After you have been running a while you will be able to tell if 
something is affecting your playerbase at a glance.
~

0 MULTIPLAYING~
Multiplaying occurs when one person a player logs on more than a single
character at a time.  For either IC or OOC reasons, multiplaying is ILLEGAL
and not to be done.  Punishment may include the deletion of a character,
deletion of all characters involved, sitebanning, or worse.  
 
While it is understandable that several friends might pool down into
a lab to mud together, it is advisable to space yourselves to avoid
harassment and questioning by IMMS.  For a good rule of thumb, you are
guilty until proven innocent.  Tread lightly.

-1 MURANDY, LUGARD~
Murandy lies just south of Andor and north of Altara.  As in many other
countries, commoners respect their local nobles more than the King.  A sense
of nationhood is virtually nonexistent in Altara, and civil strife is
common.  Murandians are highly suspicious of Andorans, the result of many
long years of border disputes between the two nations.

Lugard, the capital city, is located in the heart of Murandy.  Filled with
shops and inns, it is the trade center for the entire nation.  The city
presents a rather unkempt appearance to foreigners, with tumble-down walls
criss-crossing the city.  Most of the streets are unpaved, and the houses,
despite their brightly tiled roofs, are generally coated in a fine layer of
dust.  Lugarders have a reputation for thievery and licentiousness.
Foreigners are considered fair game for con games and theft, so its best to
watch one's wallet when dealing with a Lugarder.

The sigil of Murandy is a red bull.  The banner consists of The Red Bull on
a field vertically striped blue and white; three blue and two white.  The
banner is fringed in blue when the sovereign is present, who happens to be
King Roedran, at the moment.

53 MWHERE~
Syntax: mwhere <name>

Mwhere shows you the locations of all mobiles with a particular name.
~

-1 MYRDDRAAL~
Myrddraal (otherwise known as fades, neverborn, halfmen, shadowmen, lurks,
fetches and sundry other names) are one of the most dangerous races in the
world. Standing about the height of humans, Myrddraal are highly
intelligent, and very similar to humans.  Having sleekly-muscled bodies,
they move with the fluid grace and deadliness of snakes.  In addition, each
Myrddraal looks exactly like every other Myrddraal, with sleek black hair
(which covers only their heads) and pale white skin.  Possessing
lightning-quick speed, they are consummate swordsmen, and extremely deadly
foes.  In addition, they have the inborn ability to step into a patch of
shadow and appear suddenly in another patch of shadow far away.  Perhaps the
most disturbing difference between them and humans, however, is the fact
that where their eyes should be, there is only skin, yet, somehow, they can
see in darkest night or brightest day.  The eyeless gaze of a Myrdraal can
cause fear in all but the most stalwart of opponents.

The only known weakness of Myrddraal is their fear of running water.  They
will go days out of their way to avoid crossing any type of stream or river.
Other noticeable traits include their telltale cloaks, which will not stir
or rustle in even the strongest of gales.  Instead, they hang straight from
the Myrddraal's body and never move.  Also, Myrddraal appear only as shadowy
mists when seen in mirrors.  Myrddraal blades are poisonous, and crafted by
shadow-forgers near the entrance to the Pit of Doom.  These blades are
tempered in the inky streams of Shayol Ghul and seasoned with the souls of
human prisoners.  Due to the nature of the weapons, the demand usually far
exceeds the supply.

Myrddraal are often put in command of groups of Trollocs, and, other than
Dreadlords and the Forsaken, are the only creatures able to control the
savage instincts of Trollocs.  They accomplish this largely through the use
of their eyeless gaze, inspiring enough fear in their soldiers to impose
some semblance of order and discipline.  In addition, some Myrddraal find it
necessary to link with their Trollocs, taking control of their minds and
wills in order to create a well-disciplined and highly effective fighting
force.  However, if the Myrddraal in control of those Trollocs in killed,
all the Trollocs sharing its link die with it.

-1 NAME~
NAMES
 
"A rose by any other name smells just as sweet."- W. Shakespeare.
 
Like most of what Shakespeare wrote, while this may be a 
pleasant sentiment, for our purposes it's just damn wrong.
Names, especially in a text environment, are the very first 
step in creating and maintaining an individual's roleplay.
Consider the following names:
     Draxxus
     Ludwem Unnerbulger
     Illethreal
     Brom
In reading all the names to yourself, already a few preconceptions
begin to kindle.  Draxxus is a warriors name.  Ludwem probably
spends alot of time reading books and cleaning ink off his 
fingertips.  Illethreal is a gaunt magical woman, while Brom is
a savage.
On this MUD, we are striving to maintain a Wheel of Time flavor. Players
are responsible for choosing names that are in synch with this
goal.  What does this mean?
If you pick names like Floyd or Larry, you will be asked to choose
a new name.  If you choose names like Allanon, Gandalf, Bilbo, or
Kirk, you will be asked to rename.  If you choose names like JKRTZ or
2hot4U, you will be asked to rename.
Common real life names are not acceptable.  Names of characters from
other books are not acceptable.  'Clever' names are not acceptable.
Thinking of naming your character after a character from the books?
Tsk. Tsk.  Please see HELP BOOK_CHARACTER.
Since the Immortal staff works hard to maintain a Role Play environment,
and since we take some abuse for our draconian allegiance to RP, we
ask that you help out by choosing a "proper" name.
If you like the sound of a name, try respelling it.  For example:
Brian = Breahan
Andrew = Androoh
Phil = Phael
Gary = Gayre
Jane = Jaine
Common tricks:
'AE' -- try replacing a single vowel with a combination of vowels.
The ubiquitous 'H' -- Chuck an 'H' in there somewhere, even if
it's a silent one.
An apostrophe -- Use this one sparingly.  "Ju'uan" for example.
Above all, be creative.  Harsh sounds = a harsh character.  Soft sounds
engender a soft character.  If you need help, please ask an Immortal
character for advice.
Council has the final say on character names.  If you feel an Immortal
asked you to change your name unfairly, please note exactly what
happened to Council.  Appeals will be considered, but be warned: We
hire Immortals that we trust.  If they say 'No', 9 times out of
10 it will remain no.

55 NOCHANNEL NOEMOTE NOSHOUT NOTELL~
Syntax: nochannel <character>
	noemote   <character>
	noshout   <character>
	notell    <character>

Noemote, noshout, and notell are used to muffle characters, by preventing 
them from emoting, shouting, and telling, respectively. Characters who are 
noshout'ed or no'telled will also not receive those forms of communication.

The nochannel command is similar, but more drastic. It prevents the victim
from using any of the channels (gossip, cgossip, Q/A, music) on the game.
Nochannels usually result from swearing or spamming or violating the
rules on public channels.
~

-1 NOTE BOARD MAIL~
The note system in WoT is based on various "Bulletin Boards". Notes are
written on a specific board, and only accesible within it.  There are
several boards that come standard with all WoT systems, these are;

General      -- Used for general discussions for any topic.
Ideas        -- Suggestions for improvement.
Announcment  -- Reserved for announcements from the implementors.
Bugs         -- For posting bugs, typos, errors, etc.
Personal     -- For personal messages between players.
Q/A          -- A Question and Answer forum.
Histories    -- Reserved for character histories only.
Roleplay     -- A story/poem/song board.

  There are also message boards for builders and immortals only.

 The system for reading, writing and managing messages is really very
simple. To do anything to a message, you must be in the board that
the message was posted on.  To change to a different board, use the command
"board" followed by either the new boards number, or name.  Once their,
these commands are available;

note write     -- Begins a new message.
note read (#)  -- Reads either the next unread note, or if a number is given,
                  then reads that note specifically.
note remove #  -- If you are the one who wrote this note, this command will
                  allow you to delete it.
note list      -- Displays all notes in the current board. Including those
                  allready read by you.
note clear     -- Clears (erases) a note in progress. If you lose link while
                  writing a note, you can use this command to erase it, or
                  simply finish your note.
note catchup   -- Sets all the notes on the current board as if you had
                  allready read them.


  This note system was originally written by Erwin Andreasen, and updated
by Gary McNickle for use with the Wheel of Time Mud system.

~

-1 OGIER~
Ogier are a peaceful and reclusive race.  Known throughout the known world
for their skills in stone-working, their primary love is the care of the
groves of trees within their Stedding.  These Stedding are places where the
One Power can neither be sensed nor channeled.  The Ogier relationship with
the Stedding is a close one, and is more fully explained in HELP STEDDING.

Not only do Ogier possess much longer life-spans than humans (oftentimes an
Ogier is not considered grown until well after the 100th year of his or her
life), they are also considerably larger.  With the men averaging 10 feet in
height or better, and the women only slightly shorter, they dwarf Trollocs
and other Shadowspawn.  Believing in taking their time to deliberate matters
thoroughly, Ogier are a deliberately slow race, and, consequently, regard
humans as overly hasty.

Some stories recount legends of Ogier fighting alongside humans in the
Trolloc Wars.  These stories report Ogier to be implacable and extremely
dangerous when angered, which perhaps explains the behavior of the
Deathwatch Ogier in Seanchan.  The Ogier of the Seanchan are implacable
fighters, grim in demeanor and resolute in purpose.  They make up a very
small percentage of the Deathwatch, but are the most prized by far.  Charged
with protecting the Empress with their lives, they carry out their duties
with zeal.  All told, they are strikingly different than their brothers and
sisters across the Aryth Ocean.

Syntax: ASAVE  <world/area/changed/list>	- Save Editing to Disk.
Syntax: ALIST                                   - Listing of Areas.
Syntax: RESET  See Help Resets.			- Set Game Resets.

Definition: [optional]  <required>  (combined arguments)

     The above commands are used to expand the game world.  The original
code is based on was written by Surreality and installed in The Isles by Locke.
It was then converted to work with Envy by Jason Dinkel, and ported to ROM
2.3 by Hans Birkeland (Hugin). Port to Rom 2.4 by Ivan Toledo (ver 1.5a).

     Inside an editor, typing COMMANDS lists working commands and ? gives
help. AEDIT and REDIT default to the current area or room. EDIT ROOM RESET
resets the current room.  Most commands with no arguments display syntax.

51 OLIST~
Syntax: olist <all/obj name>

Olist is a command within redit that allows you to view the vnums of
specified objs. If the argument is all, then all of the objs created in the
zone being edited will be displayed. If a keyword is used as an arguement,
any and all objs within the zone being edited with a matching keyword will
be displayed. Name and vnum are listed in both displays.

0 OOC 'OUT OF CHARACTER'~
OOC stands for "Out of Character" and is a channel and a state of action.

________________________________
The channel OOC:
Syntax: ooc <what you want to say>

This is a way for people across the mud to talk about Out of Character
things, such as chatting or things in the real world.

_________________________________
The act of being OOC:

If you do something that would not fit in well to Robert Jordan's world,
it is considered Out of Character, or OOC. Doing things such as kissing
the Amyrlin Seat in public or dancing on the Queen's throne would be
considered OOC. However, to avoid confusion, stating that you are being Out
of Character is highly recommended.

Syntax: open   <object|direction>
Syntax: close  <object|direction>
Syntax: lock   <object|direction>
Syntax: unlock <object|direction>
Syntax: pick   <object|direction>

~

0 ORDER~
Syntax: order <character> command
Syntax: order all command

ORDER orders one or all of your charmed followers (including pets) to
perform any command.  The command may have arguments.  You are responsible
for the actions of your followers, and others who attack your followers
will incur the same penalty as if they attacked you directly.

Most charmed creatures lose their aggresive nature (while charmed).

If your charmed creature engages in combat, that will break the charm.

  See also BUY, PETNAME.
~

51 OSHOW~
Syntax: oshow <obj vnum>

Oshow, a command used inside redit, allows you to view a certain obj's
statistics without actually leaving the editor. This does not, however,
allow you to edit the mob, simply view. The object does not have to be in the
zone being edited.

See also: REDIT, OEDIT~

0 OUTFIT~
The outfit command, usable by levels 5 and below, equips your character with
a new set of sub issue gear (banner, weapon, helmet, shield, and vest),
courtesy of the Mayor's warehouses.  Only empty equipment slots are affected.
~

57 PARDON~
Syntax: pardon <character> killer
	pardon <character> thief

Pardon pardons a player for their crimes.  Don't pardon a player unless you
are sure they deserve it.  Being killed by Hassan acts as an automatic
pardon.
~

-1 PARRY~
If at first you fail to dodge, block it.  Parry is useful for deflecting
attacks, and is succesful more often than dodge.  Parry requires a weapon for
full success, the hand-to-hand skill may also be used, but results in reduced
damage instead of no damage.  The best chance of parrying occurs when the
defender is skilled in both his and his opponent's weapon type.
~

0 PASSWORD~
Syntax: password <old-password> <new-password>

PASSWORD changes your character's password.  The first argument must be
your old password.  The second argument is your new password.

The PASSWORD command is protected against being snooped or logged.
~

55 PEACE~
Syntax: peace

Peace causes all characters in a room to stop fighting. It also strips the
AGGRESSIVE bit from mobiles.
~

-1 PEEK~
The peek skill is useful for seeing what a player or monster is carrying,
the better to use the steal command with.  More intelligent characters are
harder to peek at.  All characters may learn peek, but thieves are the most
common practicioners.
~

0 PET PETS~
You can buy pets in the pet shop.  You may own only one pet at a time, after
the old one dies you may purchase a replacement. Your pet's name and
description can be changed with the petname command.

  See also PETNAME.
~

0 PETNAME~
Syntax: petname name <name>
Syntax: petname short <short description>
Syntax: petname long <long description>

This command allows you to rename your pets!  The syntax is really quite
simple, you have four options; [name|short|long|desc] and they work like
this.

examples:

  petname name dino  (renames your pet to "dino")
  petname short a fierce, mottled mutt!
  petname long Dino, the stalwart companion of (your name) is here.

The "desc" command works just like it does for setting your own description.
Use the same command syntax for this option. See "help description" for more
information on the "petname desc" option.

A word about `Bc`Ro`Yl`Mo`Wr.

Dont try to put colors in your pets name! *boggle* It wont work, trust me.
However, colors work fine for any of the descriptions.

~

56 PFLAGS~
Syntax: pflags

pflags is a command which provides a list of specific talents that are
possessed by players currently online. Currently this only covers wolfkin 
(wolf) but in the future may include some of the following.
Dreaming, fortelling, Create Angreal, Ta'vern, Seeing Ta'vern, 
sniffing, and others that will be spun out as the wheel turns.
~

-1 PICK 'PICK LOCK'~
Lock picking is one of the prime skills of thieves, allowing them to gain
access to many secured areas.  Lock picking chances are improved by
intelligence, and hindered by the difficulty of the lock. Other classes may
learn to pick locks, but they will never find it easy.
~

-1 PKILL PKILLING PKILLER 'PLAYER KILLING' PSTEAL PSTEALING 'PLAYER STEALING'~
The art of Player Killing and Player Stealing are part of the roleplay of
any Jordan based Mud.  The world is based on conflict.  Still, to maintain a
level of fun for everyone, certain rules are set:

**PK is defined as attacking another player or channelling a weave of
malicious intent (ex, poison, weaken, sleep) upon them.  

1) You must have prior RP with the player you are about to enter battle
with.  This RP does not expire until one of the players is KILLED or
recreates.
2) You must be guilded to initiate a PK with another player.
3) You must be within 5 levels of your victim.
4) If you are going to join a PK already in progress, you must give some 
form oc IC warning prior.  Either by shouting a rallying cry, or directly
rp'ing parties involved.
5) Players in the middle of OOC levelling are still subject to RP for PK.  RP
takes precedence over whatever the character is doing OOC.  Keep in mind
that OOC'ly asking for a deferment of RP PK is possible, but at the
discretion of the player instigating the rp.
6) Players in the middle of guild tests, assignment, or quests cannot be
subject to PK or PK RP.
7) Players wishing to initiate a PK must be logged into the mud (not idle
or linkdead) and VISIBLE for five minutes prior to the attack.  It is every
players responsibility to know when their enemies are around.
8) It is perfectly legal for you to assist your guild members or RP friends
in a PK as long as you follow rule #4.  However, it is NOT legal to log
one character off and log in another to make this assist once PK has
started.  While you as a player may know all that is going on, your
characters do not.  This is called "Character Ignorance" and is a vital
aspect of proper RP.

Once a player is defeated, they are knocked unconscious.  The victor may
then loot 1 object for every 10 levels he has (containers count as a single
object) or may KILL them.  KILLING a player deletes them from the game. 
Life's not fair.  Repeated KILLINGS may earn you a reputation and SLAYER may
sense a challenge.  

See also RP, IC, GUILD, GUILD_AREAS.  
~

52 POOFIN POOFOUT~
Syntax: poofin  <message>
Syntax: pooffout <message>

The standard messages for goto are 'arrives in a swirling mist' and
'leaves in a swirling mist'.  You can replace these messages with messages of
your own choosing using the poofin and poofout commands.  These messages
must include your name somewhere in the string.

Poofin and poofout only show to characters who can see you.
(see also goto)
~

0 PRACTICE~
Syntax: PRACTICE
Syntax: PRACTICE <skill|weave>

PRACTICE without an argument tells you your current ability level in all
the skills and weaves available to you.  You can check this anywhere.

PRACTICE with an argument pratices that skill or weave.  Your learning
percentage varies from 0% (unlearned) to a maximum at 75%, depending
on your class.  You must be at a Trainer to practice.  To raise your
skills past that maximum can only be done through continued use.

The higher your intelligence, the more you will learn at each practice
session.  The higher your wisdom, the more practice sessions you will
have each time you gain a level.  Unused sessions are saved until you
do use them.
~

-1 PROMPT~
Syntax: prompt
Syntax: prompt all
Syntax: prompt <%*>

PROMPT with out an argument will turn your prompt on or off.

PROMPT ALL will give you the standard "<hits ability moves>" prompt.

PROMPT <%*> where the %* are the various variables you may set yourself.

        %h :  Display your current hits
        %H :  Display your maximum hits
        %a :  Display your current ability
        %A :  Display your maximum ability
        %v :  Display your current endurance
        %V :  Display your maximum endurance
        %x :  Display your current experience
	%X :  Display experience to level
        %g :  Display your gold held
	%s :  Display silver carried
        %l :  Display your alignment
        %r :  Display the room name you are in
	%e :  Display the exits from the room in NESWDU style
	%c :  Display a carriage return (useful for multi-line prompts)
        %R :  Display the vnum you are in (IMMORTAL ONLY)
        %z :  Display the area name you are in (IMMORTAL ONLY)

Example:  PROMPT <%hhp %mab %vmv>
        Will set your prompt to "<10hp 100ab 100mv>"

  See also ABILITY, BRIEF, COLOR, HP, MOVEMENT.
~

59 PROTECT~
Syntax: protect <character>

Protect is used to protect and unprotect a character from snooping by
anyone.  Removing protected status from a character WILL be seen by 
that character.
~

52 QGEN~
QGEN

QGen is a means to create unqiue, personalized Quest eq.  This file will
explain the rules for it as well as detail all the commands it uses.  

QGen Rules-

-You may create only 1 piece of Qgen generated quest eq per Quest.  The only
exception to this is if you are another Imm(s) are running a multi-level
Quest.  IE a lowbie group and a high level group.  Even then each group will
only receive 1 piece of eq made for their group.  

-EQPoints: The max number of eqpoints (read the HELP EQUIPMENT_POINTS file)
you can pump into your QuestEQ is based on the following values.  Levels
1-10=6pts.  Levels 11-25=10pts.  Levels 26-40=14pts.  Levels 41+=16pts. 
(Note 1 EQPoint is equal to 1 QPoint).  

-Stats: QuestEQ is powerful, however there are some guidelines you must
follow.  Balance your EQ out.  There should never be a piece of EQ with
+4/+4 hit/dam and nothing else.  Use your imagination and make it unique. 
NEVER put negative stats into the EQ to free up additional points.  (The
only exceptions are for AC (armor class) and saves, which neagtive stats are
good) Anyone caught doing this will be demoted and lose their right to run
Quests.  

-Never reuse your QuestEQ for other Quests.  QuestEQ can not be restrung and
each Quest should have brand new, original prizes.  

-Your alts may NEVER possess QuestEQ made by you.  

-The name of your EQ must match the description(s).  IE no hidden keywords. 

-QuestEQ is for Quests only.  It may not be given out as a reward to your
Guildies or morts.  Period.  

-Qpoints are given out by Council on a weekly basis, if you use all your
Qpoints in 2 days....  Too bad.  Qpoints do not carry over week-to-week you
will be reset each week.  

-Do not put the QuestEQ on the Quest mobs.  It is to nbe given out only at
the conclusion of the Quest.  

-Weapons are not allowed as QuestEQ.  Period.  

-QuestEQ names/descriptions MUST be IC.  No Nikes or Levis, etc.  

-DO not make QuestEQ for other Imms, if they burned up their Quest points...
They have to wait until next week.  

QGen is a tool to help makes Quests more unique and rewarding for morts.  Do
not abuse it or it will be taken away from you.  Read the Help QUEST_RULES
for more guidelines for running Quests.  

`RAll instances of Qgen are logged automatically and your name is hard-coded
into it.  If you cheat you WILL be caught.  `w 

QGen Commands-

Start- Starts the Qgen process.  

Finish- Ends the Qgen process and loads the EQ into your inventory.  DOUBLE
CHECK YOUR WORK!

Type' for a full list.  

Cost- This is the items worth in silver.  Leave at 0.  

Level- This sets the eq's level.  The level determines the amount of QPoints
you can use for the piece.  

V0, V1, V2, V3, V4- This sets the armor value(s) for TYPE_ARMOR.  Also used
for setting furniture flags.  

Show- Displays the status of the Qgen piece being worked on.

commands.  Make sure you check your work before typing 'qgen finish'.  Once
thats been done the QuestEQ can not be changed.  The file HELP
EQUIPMENT_POINTS lists all the possible stats you can add and their cost(s).
And yes, QuestEQ is allowed to have `Rc`Go`Yl`Mo`Cr`w.  Enjoy Qgen!  
~

-1 QUEEN'S_GUARD_GUILD~
`RQue`Wen's Gu`Rard`w

1) Must be at least level 15.  

2) Highly recommended that you be a Andoran.  

3) No male channelers are permitted.  

4) Be prepared to BEGIN your training in weapons and combat, I am not
looking for a bunch of "rp'd" blademasters who refuse to learn from their IC
instructors.  

5) Be willing to teach others after you have risen in the ranks, and send
'reports' on what was taught and how things went.  

6) Must complete an IC interview with Gareth Bryne or someone he has
authorized to take care of interviews.  You must have an IC history (5
lines) in place, and an IC description.  Also be prepared to talk about
where you are from, family, etc.  

Roleplay: The Queen's Guard will essentially be 'patrolling' the realm of
Andor.  Since we are currently in beta, and going after people killing
Queen's Guard mobs would not be sanctioned...  Yet.  You WILL be involved in
pkill if someone steals or commits a crime within the realm.  Also, remember
that you are not immortal, you may find yourself being subdued a few times,
so BE PREPARED.  Any pkill however MUST be preceeded by roleplay 

PKILL WARNING: Pkill is NOT authorized at this time on Tarmon Gaidon, the
immortal staff will notify the mud when this restriction is removed.  Any
unauthorized pkill by Queen's Guards will result in nasty punishment.  The
only reason the pkill information is in the previous section is so that this
file will not require updating at the time of pkill permission.  

Captain-General Gareth Bryne

51 QUEST_RULES~
QUEST RULES

1.  Read the help Qgen file.  Live and die by them.  

2.  You may give out additonal rewards for Quests.  Ie a restrung container,
a little bit of money, a quest herb.  Use your judgement, a quickie Quest
should not see morts laden down with 10 rewards.  

3.  Try to spread the levels of the Quest around.  Let the newbies have some
fun too.  

4.  Quests may be IC or OOC.  Make sure the morts undertand this .  RP
gained in Quests carries over only in IC Quests.  

5.  Do not run Quests derived from plot points in the books.  These will be
special events planned by Council.  

6.  If using characters from the books in your Quests.  Ie Forsaken, the
LCC, etc.  Make sure they act appropriately and do NOT kill them off.
Book baddies should always escape at the last moment.

7.  When you are running a Quest, your words are law.  If any mort acts in a
unappropriate manner, remove them from the Quest.  
 
`R*`w As always use common sense. If something seems wrong, it probaly is. Do not take the chance you may lose your right to run Quests.
 
`R*`w Feel free to colaborate with your fellow Imms to run monster Quests. Do not run a Quest just for the sake of running one, make each one special and unique.

* Quest rewards should have the theme of the quest.

* Quests are NOT to disrupt/ take place in 100% IC areas (ie guild).
 
* No imm is to run more than 2 quests in a sunday-> saturday week.

`R*`w As always remember the #1 rule. Its JUST a game.
~

0 QUIT SAVE~
Syntax: QUIT
Syntax: SAVE

SAVE saves your character and object.  The game saves your character every
15 minutes regardless, and is the preferred method of saving.  Typing save
will block all other command for about 20 seconds, so use it sparingly.
(90+ players all typing save every 30 seconds just generated too much lag)

Some objects, such as keys, may not be saved.

QUIT leaves the game.  You may QUIT anywhere.  When you re-enter the game
you will be back in the same room.

QUIT automatically does a SAVE, so you can safely leave the game with just one
command.  Nevertheless it's a good idea to SAVE before QUIT.  If you get into
the habit of using QUIT without SAVE, and then you play some other mud that
doesn't save before quitting, you're going to regret it.

  See also PASSWORD.
~

-1 RACE RACES~
The various races of the WoT world each have their own special traits and
abilities. By far, the most common of the races is Human, but the occasional
Trolloc, Myrddraal, or numerous others may be found as well.

WoT Mud current supports the following races as player characters, some of
these may or may not be allowed by your implmenentor, or may be chosen only
by special favor of your muds imms.

See: Human, Trolloc, Myrddraal, Ogier
~

0 READ~
The ability to read Ogier script is a rare one amongst humans, but it is
still possible.  The Read skill allows one to read the markings found upon
portal stones and other Ogier artifacts.  Even with the Read skill, one is
not guaranteed safety when walking the Ways, as Machin Sin has a will of its
own and feeds on the living.  Still, this skill will show the reader the
correct path, so they can hasten their journey and get out as quick as they
can.  
 
While anyone can gain this skill, Ogier receive it upon Guilding at no
cost, so it would be wise for them to forego it at first.
~

59 REBOOT SHUTDOWN~
Syntax: reboot
	shutdown

Reboot restarts the mud.  When the normal 'startup' script is used
to control the server, a delay of fifteen seconds will ensue (to allow
old connections to die), followed by a reboot. A copyover is the prefered
method for making changes that require a reboot.

Shutdown shuts down the server and prevents the normal 'startup' script
from restarting it. Shutdowns will normally only be done if major changes
are needed before a copyover/reboot or if the server the mud is hosted on
is being rebooted.
~

0 RECALL /~
Syntax: RECALL

RECALL is an OOC transport which brings your character to a pre-set
location.  For most characters, this will be dependent upon your
nationality.  Once guilded, your RECALL point may change to somewhere in the
guild.  '/' is a synonym for RECALL.  

If you RECALL during combat, you will lose experience (more than for
fleeing), and you will have a chance of failing (again, more than for
fleeing).  This chance is based on your recall skill, although a 100% recall
does not insure success.  

RECALL costs half of your endurance.  

RECALL doesn't work in certain light-forsaken rooms.  Characters woven with
curse may not recall at all.  
~

0 REDIT~
Syntax: edit room		-Enters the editor for the current room.

The following commands are available from within the REDITOR:

commands            - prints a list of possible commands
create <vnum>       - creates a room with a certain vnum
desc                - edit description of room
done                - exists the room editor and returns to normal play
ed                  - type this command for additonal extra-description help
format              - format(wordwrap) the room description
name <room title>   - changes the room title
show                - hitting return, or 'show' shows the room stats
oshow <vnum>        - shows an object with given vnum
olist               - lists objects in this area.
mshow <vnum>        - shows a mobile with given vnum
mlist               - lists mobiles in this area.
rlist                  - lists the rooms in this area.
<room-flags>        - room attributes, type ? ROOM for a list
<sector>            - terrain of room, type ? SECTOR for a list
<direction>         - see help EXIT, or type <dir> ?
~

56 RENAME~
Syntax: RENAME <oldname> <newname>

Rename is a immortal command that allows the mud's staff to rename a
character that has choosen an unacceptable name in creation. This gives
the mud staff a useful tool to give a character a new name online without
manually editing the players pfile then making the player quit and
relogin.
~

-1 RENT RENTAL~
You can rent a room in most any inn, however, the inn keepers all keep in
touch, and you can only rent one room at any given time.  Renting a room
set's that room to "private", meaning that only you can enter the room,
it also doubles the regenerative properties of the room you've rented.
Rentals typically cost 30 gold, and last as long as your stay in
the town's vicinity (ie, til you log out).  You can also release
your room if you choose to 'checkout'.

~

0 REPORT SCORE WORTH~
Syntax: report
Syntax: score
Syntax worth
 
REPORT shows your current statistics to you and also announces them to
other players in the room.

WORTH lists the gold and silver you carry on you, your current experience
points, and how many you need until your next level.
 
SCORE shows much more detailed statistics to you only.  Your attribute
scores are shown as (base|modified|maximum).  So for example,
Str: 16|19|25 means your base strength is 16, your strength modified
through skills, weaves, equipment is 19, and your maximum strength is 25.

~

-1 RESCUE~
RESCUE
A friend in need is a friend indeed.  And when in combat, a warrior with the
rescue skill is just the friend you need.  Rescue allows you to intercede in
combat, protecting weaker characters from bodily harm.  Hopefully the favor
will be returned.  Success in rescuing depends on the skill rating, as well
as a comparision of level, dexterity, and speed between the character and
the target.  (note: you rescue a friend, not the monster) 
~

0 RESETS~
Syntax:RESET <number> OBJ <vnum> <location on body>    - equips last mobile
        RESET <number> OBJ <vnum> inside <obj vnum>     - store in container
        RESET <number> OBJ <vnum> room                  - store in room
        RESET <number> MOB <vnum> [<max #>]             - load a mobile
        RESET <number> CHANCE <percent>        - randomizes an objects reset %
        RESET <number> DELETE                           - delete a reset

RESET alone will display the resets in the current room.  The <number> will
be displayed with this list.  Typing ? WEAR-LOC will list possible locations
that an object can be loaded to.  The [<max #>] is the maximum number of
mobiles allowed in this room and will default to 1 if no number is entered.

For resets to be successful make sure that you add them in a logical order.
For example if you are equiping a mobile don't load a container in the room
and fill it with some objects and then continue equiping the mobile.  It is
likely that resets will backfire if they are not carefully entered.

If you wish to reset the room then use EDIT ROOM RESET.
~

0 REST SLEEP STAND WAKE POSITION~
Syntax: rest
Syntax: sleep
Syntax: stand
Syntax: wake

These commands change your position.  When you REST or SLEEP, you
regenerate hit points, mana points, and movement points faster.
However, you are more vulnerable to attack, and if you SLEEP,
you won't hear many things happen.

Use STAND or WAKE to come back to a standing position.  You can
also WAKE other sleeping characters.

  See also MOVEMENT, SCAN.
~

56 RESTORE~
Syntax: restore <character>
	restore room
	restore all

Restore restores full hit points, mana points, and movement points to the
target character.  It also heals poison, plague, and blindness.

Restore room (or restore with no argument) performs a restore on every player
in the room, restore all does the same for all connected players. Restore all
is only usable by creators and implementors.  Restore should be used sparingly
or not at all.
~

60 RESTRICT~
Syntax: restrict </show, /remove, /save> <name> <reason>

Restrict is used to add names to the banned/bad names list. In some cases 
the mud will automatically add names to the banned name list such as
if pk mode is defined. 

restrict name reason  - will add the specified name to the ban list with
			the stated reason

restrict /show        - will list all names on the banned list. can also
		        type restrict by it's self to show this

0 RESTRINGER ACT_RESTRINGER~
Restringer mobs are special mobs that serve the purpose of creating a
more personalized IC experience between players and their characters.  By
use of a restringer mob, you can change the description of any one item into
another.  Although wear locations will stay the same, this offers players a
much better alternative to wearing non-ic equipment (as all equipment is
considered IC).  The works of restringer mobs will not be able to tamper
with the descriptions on QUEST, GUILD, or REWARD equipment.  
 
The cost for restringing an item equates to 10 gold multiplied by the
level of the object.  Each field, the name, the short description, and
the long description, must be done separately.  Gilders make quite
a living after perfecting their craft.
 
The syntax for activating a Restringer mob is as follows:
  restring <obj> <field> <string> 
    fields: name short long

-1 RHUIDEAN~
Deep within the Aiel Waste, there is rumored to be a grand city named
Rhuidean.  It is said that Aiel must enter Rhuidean for a "testing" in order
to become clan chiefs or Wise Ones.  Until recently, this city was
apparently uninhabited, but there have been rumors trickling out of the
Waste of a lake suddenly sprung up from the desert floor, and Aiel
inhabiting the city.

~

0 RIDING~
People with the riding skill are more familiar with the riding of horses
& as such are able to properly utilize one as a mode of transportation or as
an aid in battle.  
~

0 RIPOSTE~
One of the more difficult maneuvers a warrior can perform is called a
'riposte'.  A riposte is a graceful parry that knocks aside your opponent's
weapon, leaving you open to deliver a devastating attack.  A difficult move
to pull off, as a simple mistake could lead you wide open to an equally
nasty attack.  
 
This is a group specific skill: Blademaster.
~

54 RLIST~
Syntax: rlist <detailed>

Rlist is used to show names on the banned list and can be called in two
ways. rlist by it's self will show a concise list of banned names. 
rlist detailled will show a detailed list of names when and why they are
banned and who placed them on the ban list.

-1 ROGUE 'ROGUE BASICS' 'ROGUE DEFAULT'~
Rogues are a marginal class.  They do few things better than any other
class, but have the widest range of skills available.  Rogues are
specialists at thievery and covert actions, being capable of entering areas
undetected where more powerful adventurers would fear to tread.  They are
better fighters than channelers, but are nowhere near as powerful as
warriors.  

Rogues begin the game with two skills based on their conniving background:
Dodge and Sneak.  Other skills and weapon proficiencies may be added as well
to help round out your character.  You may add them in character generation
or buy them with Trains throughout game play.  
 
The more specific Combat Groups offered to Rogues are:
Assassin, Thief, Bard, Siswai N'Dore, Manshimai
Each has its own Help file.
~

0 ROLEPLAY RP~
Roleplay, or RP for short, is a very fun activity that is very much
encouraged on this mud. It is just a way of doing things according to
different rules than those that our real world enforce. RP is acting IC and
interacting with other players.

RP can be used as a noun and a verb, depending on the use. If someone says,
"My character's RP is that he was born here, blah blah", then they are saying
that this character or person acts as though this is what happened to them
and this is their life/experience so far in the WoT world. If someone says,
"We had some fun RP yesterday!", then they are stating that they interacted
ICly with some other players, and had fun doing it (of course).

RP is a skill, and usually not simply "gifts" to certain people. It is a
combination of imagination and creativity. Practice makes perfect in RP,
also. The more you do it, the better you will become. It helps some people
to actually imagine that you are the character, and have lived their life,
and then simply react accordingly.

-1 ROM~
ROM started in early February 1993, using Merc 1.0 code. In July of 1993,
ROM II was started, eventually replacing the original ROM.  ROM was up for
a little over a year, after which the code (version 2.3) was released,
and various other ROM muds were started, including Rivers of Mud under
a new management (Zump's ROM), at rom.org 9000.

Alander's current project is Athen, the sequel to the ROM code.
It will be found at hypercube.org 6666, when it is opened.

The following people contributed to the ROM flavor of the merc base code:

Socials --
    Kelsey and Liralen

New, Improved Valhalla --
    Liralen

Puff's new special proc and improved poofin/poofout code --
    Seth

Maps and map shop --
    Ezra, Regnan (Olympus)

Nirvana zone --
    Forstall (mobiles rewritten by Alander)

Mob Factory --
    Pinkfloyd (originally written for ROM, mobiles rewritten by Alander)

Geographically correct Midgaard (tm) --
    Alander

Ideas and playtesting --
    Thousands of dedicated mudders around the world

Beta testing --
    Ken Blosser, Doug Araya, and Sherene Neil all helped with bug reports
    and suggestions, saving a lot of headaches

New Thalos area was donated by Onivel of Jedi, who was also the originator
of the ASCII flags used in the zone files

ROM 2.4 was developed during my time with Moosehead mud, and the release
shares many of the features I wrote while I was there.  Additional code
was written by Seth Scott (enchant armor, the new poofin/poofout), and many
contributions and ideas from the Merc list were used.  Portions of Rusty's
code from Moosehead also remain.

The new features of 2.4 were largely produced in bull sessions with
Gabrielle Taylor and Brian Moore, without whom this release wouldn't
have happened.  In particular, the new privacy code, furniture, and
wiznet are largely the results of Gabrielle's ideas.

Changes to the standard diku mob and object format, as well as the changes
to Merc 2.1 source code, were done by Alander over many a late night of
hair-pulling. Hope you enjoy it.

(my apologies if anyone was forgotten in this list)

-1 RULES~
These are the rules of WoT.  For other matters, use common sense.

* You are responsible for your roleplay in all circumstanes.  HELP RP.

* Limited player killing and stealing.  HELP PK.

* Your presence here is a privilege not a right. Obey any orders from IMMS, and
  you will be fine.  Deletion does not require a reason, appeals are to be sent
  to the implementors.

* Sitting around idle with a client is hazardous to your health. If we catch
  you doing it, you will lose half your playing time.

* No multiple logins, multiple playing, or helping your own characters with
  other characters you own -- by any arrangement.  Help MULTIPLAY.

* Cheating will not be tolerated.  This includes accepting favors from gods
  and exploiting bugs. If you find a bug, report it, then do not use it.

* Cursing or pathetic masks are not allowed on any mortal channel. 

* Continuous recreates to gain better stats will not be tolerated.

* Changes to these rules are at the discretion of the Council, and may be
done without warning, notice, or even evidence of sanity. Walk softly,
and carry a black stick.

0 SACRIFICE~
Syntax: sacrifice <object>

SACRIFICE offers an object to the Creator, who may reward you.
The nature of the reward depends upon the type of object.
 
  See also KILL, MORGUE.
~

0 SAIDIN SAIDAR~
The Wheel of Time is driven by the True Source, from which both halves of
the One Power can be drawn.  Working both together and against eachother, it
is Saidin and Saidar which provide the driving force that turns the Wheel. 
Saidin is the male half of the One Power, while Saidar is the female half. 
Though the two halves of the Power work to drive forth the Wheel, they are
as different as night and day.  The differences between the two aspects of
the Power vary so greatly, that it is impossible for a woman to teach a man
in the use of the Power and vice versa.  In fact, similar feats may be
attempted through use of the Power, but the mechanics behind them alone
could still or kill a channeler if it was attempted in the fashion of the
complimentary Power.  

At the moment, the male half of the Power, Saidin, has been horribly Tainted
by the Dark One.  What exactly this Taint is or how to cure it is unknown,
but one thing is for certain- no man can channel the Power for long without
the fear of death or insanity taking him.  (This IS hard-coded).

~

-1 SAM'DAIN~
The Sam'dain battle group is a specialization of two-handed weapons. Meant
to literally crush an opponent through strength and power, this technique
forfeits much in the way of defense and self-preservation. Players who chose
this battle group will gain the following skills (upon level requirements):

[1 ] guardcrush
[2 ] third attack
[3 ] critical strike
[4 ] enhanced damage
[5 ] axe
[6 ] bash
[7 ] polearm
[8 ] berserk
[9 ] disarm
~

0 SAY OSAY DIRSAY TSAY~
Syntax: say <message>
Syntax: osay <message>
Syntax: dirsay <target> <message>
Syntax: tsay <message>
 
All of these commands send messages to other players in the same room or
environment.  A sleeping or stunned character will not hear these messages.
 
SAY sends a message to all awake players in the room.  The single quote '
is synonymous for SAY.
 
OSAY works as SAY does, but prefaces your statement OOC'ly.  Used for
communication outside the rp forum.
 
DIRSAY sends a message to all awake players in the room, but is used to
direct your comment to a single individual.  Others will be shown who
your comment is directed at.  This command is punctuation sensitive.
 
TSAY sends a message to all the awake players in a certain setting, in
mud language- to all players in a specific furniture flagged "is_place".
Generally, furnitures flagged this will give notice of this command.
 
  See also COMMUNICATE
~

0 SCROLL~
Syntax: scroll
Syntax: scroll <number>

This command changes the number of lines the mud sends you in a page (the
default is 24 lines).  Change this to a higher number for larger screen
sizes, or to 0 to disabling paging.
~

0 SEAFOLK 'ATHA`AN MIERE'~
The Atha'an Miere are a **very** secretive folk about almost everything. They
send out a few women periodically to the White Tower so that the Sedai will
leave them and their secrets alone. The Seafolk are the best traders in the
world. They go beyond the Aiel Waste to get the silks and spices they sell.
Often, it is the women of Arad Doman that get credit for trading skill, but
it is the Seafolk who use skill rather than seduction.

Naturally dark from living their lives in the sun out on the sea, it is
considered one of the highest insults to call a Seafolk a Son or Daughter of
the Sands. None of the men wear noserings, although they as well as the women
wear several sets of earrings, depending on rank.

The women hold the most power in the Atha'an Miere society, the Mistress of
Ships being the overall leader, along with her assistant the Master of
Blades. The Windfinders have their own places of power and such. For more
information about the Seafolk power, see HELP SEAFOLK_POWER.

Often, in books the Atha'an Miere women are described as being "the epitome
of alluring beauty and temptation, pursued by all men". Out on the sea,
they take off their shirts, but once land is in sight they replace them.

-1 SEANCHAN, SEANDAR~
Little is known of the imperious Seanchan who have so plagued the continent.
The Seanchan continent lies far to the west of the main continent across the
Aryth Ocean.  It is ruled by the Empress, who is a direct descendent of
Luthair Paendrag.  Seanchan is a highly stratified society, with those
descendants of Artur Hawkwing ruling as nobles.  People are consistently
bought and sold, including female channelers, who are kept in servitude by
a'dam.  In addition, Seanchan soldiers have been known to control large
monsters, which they call "exotics" (which even includes female channelers,
who are called damane).  These Seanchan have become quite a nuisance, taking
over most of the nations along the southern edge of the Aryth Ocean, as well
as Amadicia and Altara.

0 SEARCH OBSERVATION~
SEARCH
Syntax: Search
A basic skill in the WoT world, Search allows you to find things
hidden from obvious view.  This includes items, mobs, exits, and
players.  This skill does not allow you to find those affected 
Folded Light (Invisibilty) and has a small recovery time.
 
OBSERVATION
A skill much like Search, one does not need key in anything for
the Observation skill to take effect.  Though it has a high cost,
The Observation skill is always in effect.
** THIS SKILL HAS YET TO BE IMPLEMENTED!

51 SECTOR~
Herein you will find a list of sectors, their movement costs to cross,
and other flags which modify them.
 
Sector (endurance cost)
Inside (1) [Dirt Kick -20%]
City (2) [Dirt Kick -10%]
Field (2) [Dirt Kick +5%]
Forest (3)
Hills (4)
Mountain (6) [Dirt Kick -10%]
Swim (4) [Dirt Kick = 0%]
Noswim [Dirt Kick = 0%]
Air (6) [Dirt Kick = 0%]
Desert (10) [Dirt Kick +10%]
 
NOSWIM Terrain is considered water, but unswimmable, thus, you must have a
boat to cross.
 
AIR Must be able to fly to move around in this sector.
~

51 SEDIT~
Syntax:

sedit delete         <social>
sedit new            <social>
sedit show           <social>
sedit <string-name>  <social> [string]

SEDIT allows online creation, deletion and editting of socials.

SEDIT DELETE <social> deletes that social. The deletion is irrecoverable,
save for restoring a backup file, so use this command with great care!

SEDIT NEW <social> creates a new, empty social.

SEDIT SHOW <social> shows all of the strings for that social.

SEDIT <string-name> <social> [string] changes a certain of the 7 strings that
make up a social. If you leave out the string, no message will be sent to
the involved characters.

There are 7 strings that make up a social:

cnoarg: Sent to character when no argument typed. E.g. X types HUG and sees:

Hug whom?

onoarg: Sent to others in the room when no argument is given. In the case of
HUG, it is an empty string, so that nothing is shown if a player types HUG
by itself.

cfound: Sent to the character if a target is found. E.g. X types HUG Y:

You hug Y.

vfound: Sent to the victim. E.g. X types HUG Y, and Y sees:

X hugs you.

ofound: Sent to others in room, if target is found. E.g. X types HUG Y.
Everyoune but X and Y see:

X hugs Y.

cself: Sent to the character if she uses the social on herself. E.g. X types
HUG X :

You hug yourself.

oself: Sent to others in room when a player uses a social on herself:

X hugs herself in a vain attempt to get friendship.

To get the player names and sexes correct, you need to use those macros:

$n - name of player
$e - he, she or it, depending on sex of player
$m - him, her or it, depending on sex of player
$s - his, her or its, depending on sex of player.

For the victim, just use the uppercase version. E.g. $N is the name of the
victim, $E is he, she or it depending on victim's sex etc.


So, to make a new social called 'epoke' which would poke eyes out, you would
do the following:

SEDIT NEW epoke
SEDIT cnoarg epoke Poke whose eyes out? (message sent to player)
SEDIT cfound epoke You poke $N's eyes out!
SEDIT vfound epoke $n pokes your eyes out! Ouch..
SEDIT ofound epoke $n pokes $N's eyes out!
SEDIT cself  epoke Being bored, you poke your own eyes out.
SEDIT oself  epoke $n pokes $s eyes out!

To get more examples, type SEDIT SHOW <social-name> to see one of the
existing socials.

The socials are stored in a file called socials.txt. Manual editting of
that file is not advised. A frequent back-up is recommended. The social
file is updated by the server as soon as anything changes.

~

0 SEIZE~
Saidin, the male half of the One Power, has been Tainted by the Dark
One's counterstroke against its sealing in the Bore.  Unlike the female half
of the Power, a male channeler must 'seize' Saidin, conquering it before it
does them.  The Taint upon Saidin has been described as trying to swim
against a torrent of ice and fire, while balancing atop the most treacherous
of peaks- if you falter for but a moment, it will annihilate you without
mercy.

~

58 SET~
Syntax: set mob   <mobile> <field> <value>
	set obj   <object> <field> <value>
	set room  <number> <field> <value>
	set skill <char>   <name>  <rating>
	set skill <char>   all     <rating>

The set command is used to modify the fields of a one of the above listed
types. Type set type without an argument to see a listing of options.
Set skill all (use on Immortals only) will set all the character's skills
to the value given.  Use string to change the strings on an object or mobile.
(see also string, stat)
~

-1 SHIENAR, 'FAL DARA'~
Shienar lies northeast of Tar Valon, flanked by the Mountains of Dhoom
and the Spine of the Dragon.  Winter there is cold enough to freeze the
sap of trees, causing them to split and crack, while to the north, the
Blight lies in sweltering heat all year round.  The men of Shienar are
trained as warriors from birth, and spend their lives fighting to hold
the Blightborder.  Because of the continuing struggle for survival in
Shienar, each man measures his worth in honor gained, and not material
wealth.  Beauty, peace, and life are valued above all else, because the
warrior will fight until death.  Men wear their hair in a topknot,
shaving their heads around it.  Shienaran cavalry is considered the
finest heavy cavalry on the continent, as warriors in leather and metal
armor sit astride armored steeds, and carry long lances into battle.
Warriors are never without one or two longswords on their backs, and
they always carry a mace, axe, or sword at their belt.  Inside their
homes, there is a weapon within reach in every room.

Fal Dara is the capital city of Shienar, and it fully represents the
military character of the land.  Standing on a high hill, with the land
clearcut around it to prevent surprise attacks, Fal Dara is a fortress
in form and function.  All roofs are of shale to prevent attacks by
fire, and are sharply angled to prevent buildup of snow and ice.  Its
tower-studded wall surrounds a city full of shops, inns, and homes,
which in turn surround the keep.  A dry moat, lined with sharp spikes,
protects the inner part of the city, and a second defensive wall
surrounds the inner keep.  Other cities include Fal Moran, Mos Shirare,
Fal Sion, and Camron Caan.

The sigil of Shienar is a swooping black hawk.  A black swooping hawk on
a field of three blue and two white horizontal stripes graces the
banner.  The current ruler is King Easar, whose sign is a White Hart.

-1 SISWAI'N'DORE~
SISWAI'N'DORE
Cost: Rogue (80) Warrior (70)

Coming from the Waste, the Aiel are possibly the fiercest fighters yet seen
by this Age.  Though they swear by the spear, and will never lift a blade,
their fighting technique has proven deadlier than any other. Wielding a
spear in each hand, while still using a leather buckler, Speardancers have a
distinct advantage over other "warriors" who claim to know how to fight with
two weapons.  These warriors only lose the "Held" armor spot and still
retain the ability to Shield Block.  Characters studying under this group
will gain the following skills (upon level requirements):

[1 ] Dual Wield         [6 ] Spear
[2 ] Hand to Hand       [7 ] Shield Block
[3 ] Second Attack      [8 ] Parry
[4 ] Third Attack       [9 ] Dodge
[5 ] Dagger             [10] Kick

NOTE: Though Aiel will gain Dual Wield, they will not be able to wear a
shield until they are guilded.  This shield MUST have the keyword BUCKLER
in the name field for this to work.
~

-1 SKILLS SPELLS~
Typing SKILL, will show you all your current skills at your level, typing
SKILL ALL will show all skills for your character and current %.  
~

57 SLAY~
Syntax: slay <target>

Slay kills a character or mob in cold blood, no saving throw. This should
only be used incase of bugged players, mobs, or items. Best not to use
this command on players if you enjoy being an immortal.
~

52 SMOTE~
Syntax: smote <action>

Smote works exactly like pmote, except you must place your name somewhere in
the string, and it will show that string to everyone in the room.

  See also COMMUNICATE, EMOTE, SAY, SOCIAL.
~

51 SNOOP~
Syntax: snoop <target>

Snoop shows you all the input and output going to a specific character.  The
character must have an open channel.  It is possible to snoop more than one
character at a time.  

Snoop self to cancel all outstanding snoops.  

As snooping is an necessary invsaion of privacy, please respect its usage. 
You may snoop a character if they are knowledgeable of it (ie, they are
having problems), RP or guild tests, or if they are suspected of cheating. 


**Snooping a character for purely "entertainment" purposes is grounds for
your immediate dismissal.  
 
See also WIZNET, LOG
~

56 SOCKETS~
Syntax: sockets
	sockets <name>

SOCKETS reports all of the visible users connected to the server, including
users in the process of logging in.  The two numbers inside brackets are the
channel number and the 'connected' state.  The 'connected' states are listed in
merc.h: 0 is CON_PLAYING; non-zero values are various states of logging in.

The optional name argument shows the site of a player, or optional can be used
to identify switched gods (i.e. socket trolloc shows the name of anyone
switched into an trolloc). This command is used in conjunction with the
disconnect command and is handy for finding multiplaying players.

Wizi immortals above the level of a player running sockets will not be
shown on sockets.
~

-1 SOVIN'DORE~
Cost: Warrior (60)

A near forgotten art of combat relying more on speed and finesse than
weapons, most martial artists spend as much time perfecting their technique
as Blademasters do.  One of the many benefits of unarmed combat mastery is
that one is never caught without a weapon.  You are the weapon. Characters
studying under this group will gain the following skills (upon level 
requirements):

[1 ] hand to hand
[2 ] critical strike
[3 ] parry
[4 ] dodge
[5 ] third attack
[6 ] fourth attack
[7 ] kick
[8 ] trip
[9 ] auto dodge 
 
** This combat group is under serious re-construction.  Please either
do not chose or be patient.  Thank you.
~

0 SPEARS DANCE~
Bred as a people, the Aiel are the fiercest fighters in the world. 
Fighting with either spear, knife, or unarmed- the Aiel have been known to
defeat several opponents at once, no matter how great the odds.  The Spears
Dance skill reflects this, allowing a single Aiel to fight multiple
opponents at the same time.  This skill allows the Aiel to keep his
opponents off-balanced, by attacking them all at the same time.  
 
This is a Guild specific skill: Aiel, Shaido.
~

0 SPHERES FLOWS~
There are five flows of the True Source, also called spheres.  The
spheres are: `CAIR`w, `wEARTH`w, `BWATER`w, `RFIRE`w, & `YSPIRIT`w.  Each character has a
distinct affiliation with each sphere, shown in the game by ability ratings
in each.  Your total ability rating is the total of your ability in all the
spheres.  Saidar and Saidin each work with all five spheres, but Saidin is
often weaker with Air and Water, and Saidar is weaker with Fire and Earth. 
Some people have a greater strength in one or two, and a very few have
greater strength in three.  It is extremely rare to have great strength in
all five spheres.

~

-1 SPLIT~
Syntax: SPLIT <silver> <gold>

SPLIT splits some coins  between you and all the members of your
group who are in the same room as you.  It's customary to SPLIT
the loot after a kill.  The first argument is the amount of silver
the split (0 is acceptable), and the second gold (optional).
Examples:
split 30 	--> split 30 silver
split 20 50	--> split 20 silver, 50 gold
split  0 10	--> split 10 gold
~

53 STAT~
Syntax: stat <name>
	stat mob  <name>
	stat obj  <name>
	stat room <number>

The stat command gives you detailed information on an object, mobile, or room
within the game.  Without a class argument, the command will return a object
(if found), a mobile (if no object exists, but a mobile does), or a room
(if a number is  given).  Stat room with no argument stats the room you are
standing in.  Stat can be used to find room vnums for goto.
(see also goto, transfer)
~

0 STEAL~
Syntax: STEAL coins <character>
Syntax: STEAL <object> <character>

STEAL attempts to steal coins, or an object, from a character.

There are penalties for using STEAL on other players.

In order to STEAL successfully, you must practice the appropriate skill.
~

-1 STEAL~
Theft is the defining skill of the thief, and is only available to that class.
It allows items to be stolen from the inventory of monsters and characters,
and even from shops!  But beware, shop keepers gaurd their merchandise
carefully, and attempting to steal from a character earns you a THIEF flag
if you are caught (making you free game for killing).
~

55 STRING~
Syntax: string obj <field> <string>
	string mob <field> <string>

The string command changes the various strings associated with an object or
mobile.  A full list of fields can be viewed by typing string obj or string
mob.  Sorry, multi-line strings are not yet supported.
~

51 SUBMISSIONS BUILDING_SUBMISSIONS~
BUILDING SUBMISSIONS

When submitting a work, you should NOT expect it to be finished for a week,
at least.  Any violation of the BUILDING_RULES file will be grounds for
immediate submission refusal. You have the option to fix it, or let the area
sit in limbo.  When an area is editted, grammar and equipment point edits
will be sent to the builder, with suggestions and comments.   Discussions and
explanations are allowed, but don't expect me to let a -10 AC cloak through.
Your grammar doesn't HAVE to be perfect, I am no English major myself- but
you MUST be open to criticism.  We are trying to set up a work we can be
proud of, something WORTHY of Jordan's world.  All equipment should be
flagged correctly and follow the rules set in both the help WEAR_ and
EQUIPMENT_POINTS files. Phil

0 SUICIDE DELETE~
Use the delete command to erase unwanted characters, so the name will be
available for use.  This command must be typed twice to delete a character,
and you cannot be forced to delete.  Typing delete with an argument will
return your character to 'safe' status if you change your mind after the
first delete.

0 SURRENDER~
Syntax: surrender

When you're fighting, you may choose to SURRENDER to your opponent. If you
surrender, you will cease fighting. Your opponent may ignore your action
(receiving one free attack) or react in some other way depending on the
situation. Fighting may always be resumed via kill command.

  See also KILL, FLEE.
~

54 SWITCH RETURN~
Syntax: switch <character>
	return

Switch switches you into the body of another character (who must not
already have a descriptor, e.g. you can't switch into a PC). You also cannot
switch into link-dead PCs.

Return returns you to your original body.
 
Immortals may switch into mobs to enhance the muds rp, to test potential
guildies, and to "escort" unwanted players from their guild areas.
~

0 SWORD_FORMS~
The sword is perhaps the most carefully studied weapon west of the
Dragonspine Mountains.  Over thousands of years and as many battles, a
standard has developed in its usage.  The Sword Forms skill is for those who
have formally trained with the weapon, under the tutelage of a master. 
While many warriors are versed in the standard Sword Forms, Blademasters
spend their entire lives dedicated to the blade and its mastery.  They are
nearly one with their weapon, and are, by far, the deadliest foes one could
face in combat.  The path to blademastery is rigorous and all-encompassing,
but those who master the higher forms are fighters of a elegant grace that
are mesmerizing to watch.  

This is not necessarily a skill, but instead an alternative
combat system for players who reach Blademaster status.
 
This is a group specific skill: Blademaster.
~

-1 TARABON, TANCHICO~
Tarabon had been primarily a trading nation before all-out chaos broke loose
some short time ago.  It had formerly been a major source of fine rugs,
dyes, fireworks, and other luxuries, but that has changed now.  The King and
the Panarch rule Tarabon jointly from Tanchico, the capital city.  The King
is responsible for spending, the army, and overseeing the High Court, and is
protected by the King's Life Guard.  The Panarch, who is female, is
responsible for the collection of taxes, customs, and duties, and also
controls the Civil Watch and lower courts.  The Assembly of Lords is
responsible for the election of the King and Panarch.

Tanchico is one of the largest cities on the continent, and perhaps the
oldest.  Taraboners call themselves the Tree of Man, and claim descent from
rulers of the Age of Legends.  Indeed, there is a wall on display in the
Panarch's Palace which bears a depiction of animals no living man has ever
seen, and the skeletons of these animals are on display as well.  In
addition to these wonders, the Panarch's Palace contains a multitude of
sculptures, cuendillar figures, and even an angreal.  The Palace is open to
the public three days a month and on feast days.  The city of Tanchico is a
wonder in itself.  High, white-plastered palaces grace the hills of the
city, and gilded domes rise from paved streets.  In addition, ships usually
fill the Tanchico Bay, which lies at the mouth of the River Andahar.
Unfortunately, Tanchico has recently fallen into disrepair, as many of the
buildings have been neglected.  Homeless refugees fill the streets, and
thieves and cutthroats nearly rule the city.  While traveling the streets of
Tarabon, it is wise to bring along strong bodyguards.

-1 TEAR~
Located well above the mouth of the River Erinin, Tear is nevertheless a
major trading nation.  Controlling all trade down the Erinin, Tear has grown
quite wealthy, and is the largest port on the Sea of Storms.  Tear is a
major producer of lamp oil, mostly derived from its expansive olive groves.
In addition, grain and fish are major commodities, and are traded up and
down the Erinin.  There are very few small towns, the result of heavy
taxation to prevent any town from growing large enough to rival Tear as a
trading center.  The Stone of Tear, which had never fallen until recently,
houses most of the High Lords, who control the country.  The Lords of the
Land are responsible for executing the decisions of the council of High
Lords.  The Stone of Tear was built sometime during or after the Breaking
using the One Power.  It houses Callandor, one of the most powerful
sa'angreal ever made.  In addition, the Stone houses one of the largest
collections of ter'angreal outside of cTar Valon.  However, channeling is
outlawed in Tear, even though Aes Sedai are allowed to stay in the country,
so long as they do not channel, that is.  Young girls are sent to Tar Valon
the day it is discovered that they can channel, and discouraged from
returning.

Outside of the massive Stone of Tear, the city is build on flat land.  The
inner city, with its paved streets, fine houses, and square-domed palaces,
surrounds the Stone.  Beyond the walls of the inner city, however, very few
of the streets are paved, and traveling the streets is extremely difficult.
Commoners in Tear are treated quite poorly by the nobles, and may not live
in the inner city unless they are servants of a lord or lady.  Those who
live outside the city live in conditions many would feel unfit even for
livestock.  Tairens, commoners and nobles alike, are notorious in their
hatred of Illianers.  The two countries are always willing to go to war
against each other, even though there has never been a decisive victory.

0 TELL REPLY GTELL GDTELL CLAN~
Syntax: tell <target> <message>
Syntax: reply <message>
Syntax: gtell <message>
Syntax: gdtell <message>
Syntax: clan <message>
 
TELL sends a message to one awake player anywhere in the world.  These are
generally considered OOC.
 
REPLY sends a message to the last player who set you a TELL.  REPLAY will
work even if you cannot see the player, and without revealing their
identity.  This is handy for talking to invisible/ hidden players or
invisible/ switchied immortals.
 
GTELL sends a message to all of the characters in your group, wherever they
are, even if they are sleeping or stunned.  ; is synonymous for GTELL.
 
GDTELL/ CLAN sends a message to all of the players in your guild, wherever
they are.  Your message will be prefaced by your rank.

-1 THIEF~
Cost: Rogue (45)

While rogues are normally an underhanded lot, Thief arch-types spend most of
their time working towards advancing their own whims through subterfuge
rather than combat.  As such, they are very sneaky, but also not too
powerful in a physical confrontation.  Still the have means at their
disposal to get by.  Characters studying under this group will gain the
following skills (upon level requirements):
[0 ] pick lock   
[1 ] backstab
[2 ] hide  
[3 ] steal
[4 ] dirt kick    
[5 ] haggle
[6 ] peek   
[7 ] trip
~

0 TICK~
Many of the game actions are based upon interval timers, including combat,
most autonomous monster actions, hp/mana/move regeneration, spell duration,
weather, and area resetting.

Of these timers, the hp/mana/move regeneration timer is popularly called the
'tick'.  Ticks on this mud average 30 seconds of real time, but the actual
amount varies randomly from 15 seconds to 45 seconds.

Area resetting happens roughly every 3 minutes if no one is in the area; less
often (15 minutes) if some one is.  Also note that objects lying on the ground
will not be regenerated if anyone is in the area when it resets.
~

0 TRAIN~
Syntax: train <str int wis dex con hp end air earth water fire spirit>

TRAIN increases one of your attributes.  When you start the game, your
character has standard attributes based on your class, and several
initial training sessions.  You can increase your attributes by
using these sessions at a trainer (there are several in town).

You gain 1 training session per level.
 
It takes 1 training session to improve an Attribute.
It takes 1 training session to increase your Hp or Endurance by 10.
It takes 10 training sessions to improve a single Flow.
 
See also ATTRIBUTE, SCORE, GAIN, PRACTICE.
~

55 TRANSFER~
Syntax: transfer <character>
	transfer all
	transfer <character> <location>
	transfer all         <location>

Transfer transfers the target character, or ALL player characters,
to your current location (default) or to a specified location. Trans all
should almost never be used, as 100 players popping into one room can have
horrible effects on slow links. 
~

0 TRAVELLING~
With a Talent in Travelling it is possible to manipulate the Pattern to
traverse space in a matter of moments or heartbeats that would otherwise
take weeks or months to travel on horseback or on foot.  
~

0 TREAT~
By treating yourself or another, you apply the basics of healing to them.
Weak pulpices, bandages, and bracings all go into the tendering of a wound,
and the treat skill ensures proper knowledge in their application.  When
wounded, you can be treated once, but further wounds can also be treated
after they are inflicted.  

Having another treat you yields a higher healing effect than treating
yourself.  
~

-1 TRIP~
TRIP

A popular method of grounding one's opponent by rogues, this skill may be
used by warriors as well.  A dastardly attack, trip knocks over one's
oppenent, partially stunning them.  While grounded, players have penalties
to their attacks and flee chances.  Tripping your opponent bases the
player's dexterities against each other, generally agile players can avoid a
trip.  

Players chosing the Sovin'Dore weapons group have an additional bonus, when
they successfully trip a player, they are quick to apply an additional
stamping, furthering the damage.  
~

-1 TROLLOCS~
Trollocs were created before The War of the Shadow to serve as soldiers in
the Dark One's armies.  A strange combination of human and animal genetic
material, Trollocs possess strength and speed far beyond that of either the
animal or human parts of their heritage.  Standing from eight to ten feet in
height, they are almost as fast as horses, and are extremely vicious
fighters.  Possessing the facial features of their animal heritage, Trollocs
have a very limited intelligence, little discipline, and all the worst of
human characteristics.  Cruel and ruthless, they have been known to eat
almost anything they find, often murdering each other too fill their
cookpots.  Because of this, it is generally necessary for them to be
controlled by a Myrddraal.

  See also HUMANS, MYRDDRAAL, OGIER, SHADOWSPAWN.
~

60 TRUST~
Syntax: trust <character> <level>

TRUST sets a character's trust to the specified level.  This is similar to
advancing the character for accessing immortal commands, but has no effect
on combat strength, et cetera.  You can give more trust to mortal (or
immortal) characters to give them access to more power without messing up
the character.  You can also restrict a player's trust to less than their
natural level.

A trust of 0 means to use the character's natural level again.
This also can be abused which is why this is a imp only command.
~

51 TYPE_ARMOR~
Designed specifically for the purpose of protecting its wearer from harm,
armor comes in a variety of shapes, forms, and materials.  From padded
leather armors to bulky plate mail, both material strength and mobility play
a part in the defense.  Please be careful when flagging armor.  All
non-metal armors should be flagged NONMETAL.  Weaves and skills will be
offered to enhance armor, so pay attention to proper flagging.  Variables
entered in the v0, v1, v2, v3 slots should always be positive intergers.  
v0 Protection against piercing attacks.
v1 Protection against blunt attacks.
v2 Protection against slashing/ hacking attacks.
v3 Protection against channelling/ exotic attacks.  (Not saving throws)
~

51 TYPE_CLOTHING~
Clothing, unlike armor, is worn for the purpose of asethetic appreciation as
opposed to practical protection.  Because of this and mud consistancy, it is
required that all objects of the sort be typed and flagged correctly. The
main reason for this is, some weaves will work better on Clothing, and some
skills might only work on Armor.  Because of this, the NONMETAL flag, which
should most always be applied to clothing (save in obvious exceptions),
becomes imperative in keeping mud/ skill/ weave balance.  If you must give
Clothing an Armor Class, give it a weakly rated one.  You might notice that
items typed Armor give Variables at the end for holding AC information.  To
give Clothing an armor value, you must use an Addaffect AC to it.  As
previously stated, if you are to give Clothing an AC, keep it weak, the
highest AC given to an object typed Clothing should be -3.

  See also BUILDING, TYPE, AC_VALUES.
~

0 TYPE_CONTAINER~
Containers come in a variety of different types and sizes.  Basically,
any object that can be used to hold others can be flagged type'd Container,
for the ease of game play.  Hence, items type'd Container can either be belt
pouches, sacks, trunks, scabbards, kettles, or even key rings.  It is really
up to the builder and their creativity.  

Now, for an explanation on Container mechanics:
v0 Weight: this is the largest weight allowed inside the container.
v1 Flags: closeable pickproof closed locked puton
v2 Key: insert the vnum for the key to lock/ unlock it.
v4 Capacity: this is the maximum weight the container can hold.
v4 Weight Multiplier: see below.
 
Weight multipliers define how much of the weight is apparent, as bulking
it generally allows one to balance and handle it better.
MIN Weight Multiplier, level -16: 90
MIN Weight Multiplier, level 17+: 80
MIN Weight Multiplier, level 40+: 70
 
See also: BUILDING.
~

51 TYPE_DRINKCONTAINER TYPE_FOUNTAIN~
Items typed 'drinkcontainer' are objects used to transport liquids to
help a player satiate their thirst.  The may be simple waterskins and
canteens, or even mugs, flasks, chalices, barrels, or inverted skulls.  All
'drinkcontainer's are portable, and thus, should have the 'wear take' flag. 

Items typed 'fountain' are stationary drink reservoirs that players can fill
their drinkcontainers from.  They may be wells, streams, barrels, or marsh
waters.  Fountains may not have the 'wear take' flag, but have the benefit
of allowing a -1 in the Liquid Total and Left variables, making them
infinite.  
 
The variables:
v0 Liquid Total: how much liquid the object can hold.
v1 Liquid Left: how much liquid the object currently holds.
v2 Liquid: what drink is contained within, '? liquid' for types.
v3 Poisoned: is the liquid within poisoned?
 
For values, the current MUD standard are mugs at 5 or 10, canteens at 20,
jugs at 40, and barrels at 100+.  Don't forget to have weights reflect this.
 
See also: BUILDING, TYPE_FOOD, TYPE_POTION
~

51 TYPE_FOOD~
Food is any type of object that the player has a chance to ingest. 
Unlike herbs, food does not give any special effects to the player save sate
their hunger.  For experienced players, you know you can't go around hungry
all the time or else you won't regenerate properly.  Common bread types are
rations, fruits, vegetables, stews, or even frogs.  Though with frogs, I
would highly suggest putting the poison flag on them.  
 
The variables:
v0 Food hours: how long until you will need to eat again.  Nourishment.
v1 Full hours: how full the food makes you.  Calories.
v3 Poisoned: is it poisoned?
 
Generally, snacks should last 5 hours, decent meals should last 10, and big
meals should last 15.  If you get confused with the difference between full
and food hours, feel free to keep the variables the same length.

~

51 TYPE_FURNITURE~
Furniture is any type of object that is designed for players to rest,
sleep, stand, or sit on, or in to facilitate healing.  A number of variables
are offered in their creation, explained below.  
v0 The maximum amount of players able to use the object.
v1 The maximum amount of weight the furniture can support.
v2 The flags: sit_, rest_, sleep_, stand_
-             _on, _in,_inside, or is_place
 
The is_place flag allows players to actually hold conversations and emotes
within the furniture, that only others within it can see.  This is used
by the 'tsay' or 'temote' commands.  Mentioning this in the object's
extra desc is allowed, such as obj 9109.
 
  See also BUILDING, HEAL_RATES
~

51 TYPE_HERB TYPE_POTION~
In the Wheel of Time, there are no mystical herbs that are total cure
alls or steroids.  In the creation of Herbs and Potions, please keep their
relative level to a minimum.  Herbs and potions should not have an affect
past level 10.  And the more powerful ones should have a drawback as well as
a benefit.  Think it through, Feverbane might cure disease, but it also
makes you really groggy.  So a minor cure disease and sleep would do the
trick.  Also, because some herbs and potions have a half life, please feel
free to give them the NOSAVE, ROTDEATH, or HADTIMER flags.  These will prove
useful in getting your area approved.  
 
HERBS
v0 - The level at which the effect is cast.
v1, v2, v3 - The effects the herb applies to its eater.
v4 - Null, has no effect on the player.
~

51 TYPE_LIGHT~
Worn as  : Light
Examples : a torch, a lamplighter's sconce, a REALLY big candelabra.

MAX EP Levels 25-: 3
MAX EP Levels 25+: 4
MAX EP Levels 45+: 5

Please note, Equipment Points listed are MAXIMUMS, they are not to be used on
each piece of equipment. ~

0 TYPE_MAP~
Items typed 'map' should include any type of literary map, work, tome,
libram, or the like.  This should help facilitate shops that specialize in
this sort of equipment, like a cartographer, limner, or librarian. 
Equipment points assigned to these objects should follow the standard
limitations of their wear location (see help WEAR_).  
 
  See also BUILDING.
~

51 TYPE_WEAPON~
The type Weapon is fairly self-explanatory- it is anything one player
might wield to inflict damage upon another.  In order to balance a sense of
reality with the growing power of players, it is important for builders to
pay strict attention to the detail of flagging weapons correctly, using the
average damage maximums prescribed, and giving the weapons the correct level
restrictions.  Everyone knows that a dagger and a 150 lb.  Battle axe
varying in the amount of damage done, generally in favor of the axe.

58 UNLINK~
Syntax: unlink <character name>

This command is used to delete a character from the mud. The character
can be online or ploaded. Once this command is run the only way to
restore the character is to restore the player file from on old backup of 
your pfiles. So be sure before you unlink anyone.
~

51 UNWRITTEN_RULES~
These are a few of the (now written) unwritten rules of building on this
mud.  
1) No heron-marked blades in any area.
2) You may only assign 2 slots (ie 2 str, 2 hitroll, 10 hp, 20 move) to
an affect on an object levels 44 and lower.  Levels 45 and above may
assign 3.
3) You may not give negative bonus' to an item to compensate for more eq points.
4) Do NOT reset objects/ mobs from an another area into the one you are 
working on.  You may ask permission of that builder and COPY the object or
mob into your area and then reset it.
5) Only one mob with Act Blademaster per area.
~

53 UPDATE~
Syntax:
updata bank

The update command updates (eventually, several) in-game mechanisms.

Update bank forces an update of the share price
~

60 VIOLATE~
Syntax: violate <Location>

The location may be specified as a vnum, as the name of a mobile/player, 
or as the name of an object.

Violate is similar to the goto command with the exception you may use
violate to enter private or solitary rooms. If the character is not in a
private room it informs you to use goto
~

0 VISIBLE~
Syntax:  visible

VISIBLE cancels your hiding and sneaking, as well as any invisibility,
making you visible again.
 
  See also HIDE, SKILLS, SNEAK.
~

56 VNUM~
Syntax: vnum <name>
	vnum <obj or mob> <name>
	vnum skill <name>

Vnum finds all objects and mobiles with a particular name, and prints out
the results.  Use vnum obj or vnum mob to limit the search.  This vnum is
very useful for loading. Vnum skill returns the skill number (for set) and
the slot number (for making new zones) of a skill name.
(see also load)
~

-1 WANDS STAVES SCROLLS~
Magical items require training to use properly.  If your character lacks the
necessary skill to use an item, he will fail, possibly destroying it.  The
item skills are as follows:

scrolls		The reading of magical scrolls and books (see 'help recite')
staves		The use of staves and similar devices (see 'help brandish')
wands		The use of wands and similar items (see 'help zap')
~

0 WARDERS GAIDIN~
The Gaidin, Brothers to Battle in the Old Tongue, are the sworn protectors of
Aes Sedai. They train in the White Tower, proceeding through ranks to become
bonded. They swear that they will die before their Sedai, and put her life
higher in importance than their own. Bonding a Warder without his consent
is about equal to raping a Sedai.  The bond between Warder and Sedai is a
unique thing, allowing both Sedai and Warder able to feel each others' pain,
strong emotions, and conditions (like being ill and whatnot). The Sedai may
use the bond to compel their Warders. Passing a bond from one Sedai to
another is a very offending action in these times.Warders VERY seldom drink
alcohol, and then not much.

~

-1 WARRIOR 'WARRIOR BASICS' 'WARRIOR DEFAULT'~
Warriors live for combat and the thrill of battle.  They are the best
fighters of all the classes, but lack the subtle skills of thieves and the
mystical talents of channelers.  Warriors are best for those who don't mind
taking the direct approach, even when another method might be called for.  

Warriors begin the game with two skills based on their martial background:
Second Attack and Enhanced Damage.  Other skills and weapon proficiencies
may be added as well to help round out your character.  You may add them in
character generation or buy them with Trains throughout game play.  

The more specific Combat Groups offered to Warriors are:
Blademaster, Weaponsmaster, Sam'dain, Manshimai, Sovin'Dore, Siswai N'Dore
Campaigner, Cavalry.
Each has its own Help file.
~

-1 WEAPONSMASTER~
Cost: Warrior (60)

Trained from birth in all aspects of war, characters choosing the
Weaponsmaster group gain proficiency in all weapons, plus learn the art of
forging and tempering them.  Though not trained to be as deadly as
specialist fighters, it is almost impossible to catch a Weaponsmaster
off0guard as they can easily turn anything within an arms reach into a
weapon. Characters studying under this group will gain the following skills
(upon level requirements):

[0 ] axe
[1 ] dagger
[2 ] flail
[2 ] flail
[3 ] mace
[4 ] polearm
[5 ] spear
[6 ] whip
[7 ] bow
[8 ] disarm
[9 ] third attack
[10] fourth attack
~

51 WEAPON_BOW TYPE_QUIVER~
WEAPON_BOW
When creating weapons of the type "bow", please keep in mind these must
be flagged 'twohands'.  You need to understand that the damage values listed
for it as a weapon do NOT refer to the arrow damage, they refer to the
damage done by the bow in melee combat.  Because of the nature of
the bow, the max avg damage should NOT EXCEED 6.

TYPE_QUIVER
The quiver actually mandates the damage done by the arrows shot from it,
as well as the number of arrows it can hold.  The cost of the quiver
should reflect both the number of arrows held and how powerful those
arrows are.  Quivers NEED to be flagged with the wear location "shoulder."
MAX AVG Damage Levels -16: 9
MAX AVG Damage Levels 17+: 13
MAX AVG Damage Levels 45+: 17
~

0 WEAPON_SPECIALS~
Included are a listing of the offered flags for weapons and a brief
description of each.  Also included is the Equipment Point cost for each, be
weary when creating your weapons.  
 
Special: Flaming (Cost 5 Equip Points)
A flaming weapon is a dangerous one, indeed.  Aside from offering a chance
to 'fireblind' your opponent, a flaming weapon can also destroy objects
flagged 'nonmetal' in your opponent's inventory, destroy their potions, and
does a little extra damage.
 
Special: Frost (Cost 3 Equip Points)
A dangerous flag at only 3 equipment points, a weapon that can frost
increases damage done, chills an opponent (sapping their strength), and like
flaming weapons, can destroy potions your opponent carries.
 
Special: Vampiric (Cost 3 Equip Points)
Quite an evil ability, a portion of the damage a player inflicts on an
opponent is absorbed by the player- as if leaching their life energy.
 
Special: Sharp (Cost 3 Equip Points)
The sharp flag gives a weapon the chance to double the amount of damage it
does, before Damage Bonus' are calculated.
 
Special: Twohands (Cost 1 Equip Point)
Weapons flagged 'twohands' will be allowed to have a higher MAX AVG damage
that those not flagged.  Builders can increase the MAX AVG damage of two-
handed weapons by 5.  This is not built into code, it must be manually done.
 
Special: Shocking (Cost 5 Equip Points)
Chars an opponents nonmetal equipment, electricutes their metal armor, screws
up their muscle coordination and attacks, extra damage... the shocking flag
has it all.
 
Special: Poison (Cost 3 Equip Points)
Weapons with the poison flag have the potential to envenom anyone hit by
them.  Not only does the poison continuously damage the player every tick,
but it prevents them from regaining HP, Ability, and Endurance back, even
while sleeping.

0 WEAVE WEAVES~
When a channeler has embraced or has seized the True Source, then they
can weave the One Power into many different forms, depending on their skill
and power.  If more of the One Power is used, or it is used in a way more
difficult that the users skill, then drastic consequences can occur.  In
game terms this means that if a weave is attempted that is above your level
there is a chance that grows with each difference in level of a bad thing
occurring.  If channeling a weave that is beyond your power in any specific
sphere, there is a chance of bad things happening for each point missing,
which doubles for each additional sphere that is lacking.  These chances are
cumulative, so casting a spell that is above your level and that you are
lacking ability for is very foolish.  Some of the bad things that can happen
if you are foolish are small to moderate losses in ability, complete
stilling, and even death.  To see a list of weaves that details the levels
of spells, and required ability in each sphere, type CH LIST.  Note that
some weaves actually drain ability, and others use up endurance.  Ability
that is used up in this way slowly returns, but returns faster if you are
resting or sleeping.  If a weave is attempted that uses endurance, and you
do not have enough endurance available, then you also again have a chance of
a bad thing happening, more for every point lacking.

-1 WHO~
Syntax: who
Syntax: who <level-range>
Syntax: who <class or race>
Syntax: who <guild name>
Syntax: who <class or race> <level-range> <guild name>

WHO shows the people currently in the game.  Some people may choose to
remain unseen and won't appear on the WHO

WHO without any arguments shows all of the (visible) people currently playing.

With arguments, WHO can show players of certain classes or levels.
For example:

who 10          lists all players of level 10 or above
who 15 20       lists all players between level 15 and 20
who rogue       lists all rogues playing

0 WIMPY~
Syntax: wimpy
Syntax: wimpy <number>

WIMPY sets your wimpy value.  When your character takes damage that reduces
your hit points below your wimpy value, you will automatically attempt to flee.
You will only flee if your character is not in a wait state -- i.e. has not
been using combat commands like cast, trip and bash, and has not been
tripped or bash by an enemy.

WIMPY with no argument sets your wimpy value to 20% of your maximum hit points.

Some monsters are wimpy.

-1 WISE ONES~
All Aiel women who can channel, as well as all Dreamwalkers, become Wise
Ones.  Even Far Dareis Mai must become Wise Ones and give up the spear if
they are discovered to have the ability to channel.  Wise Ones are trained
in healing, herbs, and other lore, and act as negotiators as well.
According to ji'e'toh, they may not be harmed or impeded.  In addition, they
must not take part in any battles.  In order to become a Wise One, a woman
must first pass two tests inside the city of Rhuidean.  There, they must
first pass through a ter'angreal much like the one inside the Tower.  The
other test remains a secret among Aiel.

56 WIZLOCK NEWLOCK~
NEWLOCK, WIZLOCK
Syntax: wizlock
	newlock

Wizlock and newlock both prevent logins to WOTMUD. Wizlock prevents 
logins from all non-immortals (i.e. level less than 51), except for 
link-dead players who are returning.  Newlock only prevents new character
generation, typically used for preventing a spammer/troublemaker from 
returning. Wizlocking should be avoided, and newlocking should be 
accompanied by mail or a note to the mud's administrative staff.

A Immortal must be at least level 58 to wizlock or newlock the game.

WIZNET
Syntax: wiznet
	wiznet show

Wiznet is sort of an immortal news service, to show important events to
the wiznetted immoral.  Wiznet by itself turns wiznet on and off,
wiznet show lists all settable flags (they are not detailed here),
wiznet status shows your current wiznet settings, and wiznet <field> toggles
a field on and off.  The events should be self-explanatory, if they are not,
fiddle with them a while.  More events are available at higher levels.

-1 WOT~
WoT Mud is a mud code designed by Gary McNickle and is based on ROM mud
by Russ Taylor.  WoT mud was designed with two goals. 1: To create a world
based on Robjert Jordan's fantasy series, "The Wheel of Time" using the
pre-existing ROM Mud code and 2: To update the ROM code, removing that
which is no longer necessary and updating as needed.  Many people have
helped along the way, my thanks to the following:

Robert Jordan
-- Without his incredible world, this code would not be.

Jonathan J. Skipp <skipper@americus.net>
-- Who provided the original test site <!!--address> for WoT and who's
mud, "The True Source" runs it still...

Beonin, al'Lan Mandragoran, Jientel, Elyas Machera
<!!ok to use real names here?>
--  Without who's help, the area files would never have been written, the
guild's would still be a out of balance and my life would be a lot duller.

Katryn
-- Full of ideas, and penner of the help files.

Mairi <!! SP?> and the entire Fires of Heaven <!!address> staff. This was
my first mud, and the people there are not only awesome, but enjoy a good
Wheel of Time RP session as much as I do.

WoT was developed during an extended down time of Fires of Heaven, and was
certainly inspired by much of their work.

51 rename_policy~
RENAME_POLICY
 
Renaming mortals is a tedious annoying duty.  But it's also one
of the most important.  As an Immortal, please talk to the mortal in
question first before simply announcing that they need to
choose a new name.  Help them work out a new name, realize what
was wrong with their prior name, and generally help them out.
Also, listen to them.  Someone who names their character something
that could go either way, may realize this and have a legitimate
RP reason for it.  If this is the case, and you feel that they have
a point, just drop a note to all immortals about it so the rest
of us don't jump on her.
Generally speaking, we are looking for fantasy names.  Not names
that are common to real life, or names from OTHER fantasy series.
If the name is -close- to a book name, just make sure that the
person isn't trying to Role Play the book character.  If they are,
direct them to HELP BOOK_CHARACTER.
What's acceptable:  Trust your gut on this.  There's no way we could
write a policy to cover every possible contingency.  Try to
be as lenient as possible without sacrificing the over-all
Role Play of the MUD.  The good of the MUD outweighs the desire
of the One (Thanks, Spock).
If there is a question, chat with your fellow Imms.  If you are the only
one on, just inform the character that they -may- be asked to rename
and explain why.  
If you need to rename someone, and for whatever reason you are
hesitant about it, blame Council.  Just tell that character that
a Council member asked them to change, and you are only the messenger.
We here at Council -love- being the bad guys.
If any character ever gives you lip, trans him to room 5 for a
few minutes until he cools off.  If he's still lippy, nochan him.
In either of these cases, note Council as to the particulars.
Council has the final say on names and name disputes. The buck
stops with us.

`yAiel`w

1) An appropriate description: A desc of at least four lines is required and
should not feature any statements of action.  This means things like "<Name>
watches you warily," etc.  Descs should only feature physical attributes
that can be seen by anyone.  How they react or what you might be doing at
the time should be left for actual rp.  

2) A personal profile/background/rp plan: What I'm looking for here is a
sense of who your character is and how they'll react to stimuli.  What are
their goals?  Do they have any quirks?  A word of advice: everyone wants to
rp the toughest fighter and the most respected and unique individual in the
world.  Most Aiel -will- be warriors, but you'll need to dig deeper than
their profession if you want to be guilded.  I want the personal details
that make this character tick.  I'm looking to build a guild with real human
beings.  Supermen and earthbound gods need not apply.  Oh, and try to give
some thought to who your parents were.  Players have a tendency to have
either dead parents or parents who were 'great warriors'.  Not gonna happen,
people.  Parents and family can provide some of the greatest rp
opportunities, so make them interesting and unique.  

3) Aiel nationality: This one's pretty obvious.  I'm not going to be
guilding any Sea Folk or Ogier and handing them a shoufa and veil.  Make
sure you're human and of Three-Fold Land descent.  

4) An extensive knowledge and rp test: This is just what it sounds like.  In
the beginning I'll be giving these tests myself.  It's my intent to make the
Aiel guild an example for the rest of the mud when it comes to rp, and in
order for that to happen I need to know that you can play an Aiel.  Aiel are
one of the most difficult races to play due to their specific cultural
practices and their sense of honor.  For the most part Aiel determined for
themselves when toh was owed and how much was required, so it is absolutely
vital I fill this guild with people who not only understand ji'e'toh
thoroughly, but are mature and responsible enough to accept the consequences
for their actions.  

5) An understanding that all things are ic: This is the tough one, and it's
because of this that I expect few members in the beginning.  Everything from
eq to levelling will be considered ic.  What this means is that no guilded
Aiel will ever be seen killing children in Caemlyn while wearing fish scales
for armor and wielding a sword from horseback.  All activity by Aiel will
take place in the Three-Fold Land and nowhere else until we reach a later
stage in the books.  The main problem with this is that the 3FL is
incredibly small at the moment and ill-suited for levelling.  I'd considered
allowing guild members to level oocly in the wetlands, but I decided that
doing such would only endorse bad habits that I'd have to correct later. 
This does not mean that you cannot level at all if you're Aiel.  It just
means that once you're; guilded you won't be allowed in the wetlands.  My
suggestion is that if you really want a guilded Aiel char for sanctioned rp,
you make an alt; specifically for that purpose.  Any guilded Aiel found
levelling in the; wetlands or wearing wetlander eq will be removed from the
guild and stripped of all guild eq and skills.  

6) An agreement to follow rules and directions set by the guild leader (me,
Amys): It's my intent to make the Aiel guild set the example for rp and
maturity on the mud.  Our main purpose is to add realism and excellent
roleplaying to the mix in a hope that such will spread beyond the confines
of the Three-Fold Land.  I am not building a race of pkers, though pk will
eventually come up.  Anyone who made an Aiel char just to be tough should
not expect to be guilded.  Further, if any Aiel's actions have a negative
affect on the Aiel as a whole, they should expect to be hunted and
perm-killed.  (Yes, permanent death is a possibility in pk).  This does not
mean you can't have an individual personality.  It just means that no Aiel,
whether guilded or not, is going to be allowed to destroy the ic atmosphere
we're trying to establish on this mud.  If you go around pk'ing gai'shain,
expect to be dealt with severely.  
 
7) No male channelers of any kind: That's right, no MC's. Any Aiel male channeler would have only one line of rp, and that would be marching to the Blight to fight Sightblinder. Since this limits the lifespan of mc's, I see no reason to waste time guilding them.

BOOK CHARACTERS.
Book characters, simply put, are characters from the Wheel of
Time books that are run by players.  These characters are NOT
generally made available to the common player, and in fact, if
a book character is created without prior Council approval, that
character will be asked to delete, or rename.
Book characters are difficult to play.  Your RolePlay has already
been fashioned by Robert Jordan, as has your appearance,
mannerisms, beliefs, and history.  Anyone playing a book character
will be REQUIRED to abide by the character parameters established
in the Wheel of Time books.  There is no margin for error.
If you cannot do this, that book character will be taken away from you.
Book characters include ANY AND ALL major characters from all novels
by Robert Jordan pertaining to the Wheel of Time world.  Yes,
this includes "A New Spring" novella.
Players wishing to run a book character may mail Izzildraah Eth
and request an application.  That immortals e-mail is available
on the imm list.

0 "PHYSICAL DEFENSE"~
Warriors who chose the Physical Defense specialty believe that the surest
way to win a battle is to survive it.  These fighters are exceptionally
adept at rolling with blows and binding their armor in a way to ensure
maximum protection.  As such, those who chose the Physical Defense specialty
will be able to increase their AC before a battle and buffer themselves from
damage during one.

0 "TINKERS TUATHAAN WAY OF THE LEAF "~
Tuatha'an are a travelling folk that live in a world of color, peace, and
song. Usually easily spotted by their almost neon clothes, "Tinkers" live in
colorful wagons and camps. The leader of the encampment is called Mahdi or
Seeker. They follow the Way of the Leaf, searching out the Song.

The Way of the Leaf is to accept what comes, and is a totally pacifist view.
Whether your belongings be stolen, your life be threatened, or family be
murdered, the Way dictates that violence is _never_ an option. Not even
wanting to touch a sword or other weapon, they live their lives usually in
peace. Children that grow up and choose not to follow the Way are called
"Lost Ones".

They search for "the Song". They have no idea what it sounds like or where to
find it, but they know that when it is found, true peace will be restored.
They travel and camp almost everywhere, but they tend to avoid cities and
villages since the people are suspiscious that they will steal their children
and possessions. They even travel across the Waste, although the Aiel shun
them as "Lost Ones".

Note: It is known by **VERY** few people ICly that the Aiel (an awfully
violent people) originally were Tuatha'an, and in the Breaking, were changed
and thrown into the Waste.

0 'AGE OF LEGENDS'~
AGE OF LEGENDS

Before the Breaking of the World, there was a time when men and women
wielded the One Power side by side with no fear of any taint on
saidin.  This was a time when there were no wars, and even the word
"war" itself was lost and known only to scholars.  During this time, all
manner of wondrous feats and abilities were nothing out of the ordinary.
This time is known as the Age of Legends today.

Three thousand years have passed since the end of that Age and its origins
have been obscured and lost over time.  The information that is known
about the Age of Legends is scarce, and has been pieced together from
scattered highly fragmented records and must be studied carefully to gain
an even partial understanding of this amazing Age.

One thing seems certain, however. This Age was indeed a very lengthy and
flourishing period in the history of the world. Enormous cities such as
M'Jinn, Adanza, Mar Ruois, Paaran Disen, and Comelle were thriving jewels
of technology amidst the fields of crops and rich greenery which
surrounded them. The great research college of Collam Daan in the city of
V'saine drew knowledge seekers from all across the land to study and
discover new scientific wonders and the One Power.

Sho-wings filled the skies, and jo-cars raced along below carrying people
from city to city.  Crime was nearly unknown, with quick and certain
rehabilitation.  It was a time of unblemished peace and prosperity, with a
seemingly limitless array of possibilities and wonders of the universe
awaiting discovery.

It was not until a disastrous research project produced the Bore into
the Dark One's prison that the horrible truth about the Dark One
began to be suspected. During the Age of Legends, the Dark One was
unknown and his touch went unfelt. The Bore changed everything.
Though the Bore was not large enough to allow the Dark One to
escape, it was large enough to allow him to touch the world.  His touch
enhanced and manipulated mankind's baser emotional problems and
motivations.  A period of dark degeneration occurred which lasted
approximately one hundred years to one hundred and ten years after the
drilling of the Bore, and in several early resources is referred to as
'The Collapse'. The name is felt to be apt, as civilization itself nearly
collapsed, and the idyllic peace and order of the world in the Age of
Legends was shattered.

The War of the Shadow, or War of the Power as it is sometimes
known, arose when those loyal to the Dark One made an attempt to free
him completely and take control.  After ten bloody years of conflict, the
War of the Shadow ended after a male Aes Sedai, known as Lews
Therin  (also referred to as the Dragon), and his Hundred
Companions launched a planned attack on the Bore.  The Bore was
sealed safely at the cost of a great number of lives.  Within it were
trapped all the Forsaken (the most powerful dreadlords that served
the Dark One) that were present at the time.

Though the Bore was sealed and the followers of the Light prevailed,
the moment the Dark One was sealed away, a "backblast" tainted
saidin even as the Companions drew upon it. None know if this was a
deliberate action by the Dark One or the result of his efforts to
prevent the Bore from being sealed.  This tainting of the male half of
the One Power lead to the greatest cataclysm in recorded time, the
Breaking of the World.

Though civilization was maintained for a good many years after the
Sealing of the Bore, an inevitable decline into barbarism resulted.
Eventually every male Aes Sedai went horribly insane, and their
insanity literally changed the face of the world.  Over the course of only
a few hundred years, mountains were razed and new ones lifted.  Sea floor
upheaval flooded what was once dry land.  This great calamity effected all
until the death of the last male Aes Sedai.  The World was Broken, and
the Age of Legends ended.

-1 'AIEL CLANS'~
The twelve clans of the Aiel are listed below:

Chareen
Codarra
Daryne
Goshien
Miagoma
Nakai
Reyn
Shaarad
Shaido
Shiande
Taardad
Tomanelle

All of these clans follow the Dragon, with the notable exception of the
Shaido.  In addition, some of the members of the other clans have refused to
believe Rand is their Car'a'carn, and have deserted and joined the Shaido.
What effect this will have on the Aiel is yet to be seen.

  See also AIEL, AIEL SOCIETIES.
~

-1 'AIEL SOCIETIES'~
There are twelve different Aiel warrior societies.  These societies, with
their Aiel names and Common translations, are listed below:

Seia Doon (Black Eyes)
The Seia Doon are an Aiel society made up of warriors who live on the edge
of their emotions.  They are most likely amongst Aiel to show their feelings
very strongly, and can be quick to anger - especially in matters of honor. 
In battle, they fight almost as berserkers, letting their rages carry them
to victory.  

Far Aldazar Din (Brothers of the Eagle)
Far Aldazar Din are much like the hunter they claim kinship to; ever
watchful, they are observant in the extreme.  They may seem to radiate pride
and confidence, with good reason, as they are Aiel, as deadly as any other
of the land.  They often serve as lookouts and guards amongst the Aiel.  

Rahien Sorei (Dawn Runners)
Carrying the ability of Aiel to run long distances in good time almost to
the exreme, Rahien Sorei are the long-rage spears of the Aiel.  They may be
used to carry messages over a long distance, or be sent ahead of other Aiel
forces to hold an enemy to a position.  Determined men, they rarely fail to
reach a goal.  

Sovin Nai (Knife Hands)
Specialists in unarmed combat, Sovin Nai will usually only carry a working
knife, preferring to use their highly-trained bodies as weapons in all but
the most extreme circumstances.  They are always ready for battle, and
constantly practice to hone their mastery of the body further.  They put
great stock in personal control, and may be utter perfectionists.  

Far Dareis Mai (Maidens of the Spear)
The Far Dareis Mai live as their name implies - warriors to the bone, they
forego marriage and children to dance the spears.  Some are called to be
wise ones, or leave their spears for a man, but some remain Maidens until
the end.  They are conscious of their place in Aiel culture, and strive to
be as good as or better than any man in what they do.  They may often seek
out danger or duty, and feel their honor strongly.  Maidens often serve as
scouts, and are almost always on the front line in battle.  

Hama N'dore (Mountain Dancers)


Cor Darei (Night Spears)
The work of the Cor Darei is after the sun has sunk.  At ease in the dark,
they are skilled in performing night-time attacks.  They may slip past most,
if not all of a hold's guard before being discovered.  Tending to be
soft-spoken and subtle, they place the utmost importance on stealth.  

Aethan Dor (Red Shields)
At any large gathering of Aiel, or even in the hold, Aethan Dor serve as
watchmen and guardians.  Often working as a guard system, they will
apprehend any criminals, and generally keep the peace.  Still powerful in
battle, one of thier charges will break any line.  Sometimes imperious, they
are usually generous and helpful, although their wrath is strong.  

Shae'en M'taal (Stone Dogs)
Shae'en M'tall are a proud group, both of their confidence in battle, and
their prowess.  Their charges cannot be held against, and they are usually
the last to leave a battle, functioning as a rear guard during withdrawals. 
Some even go so far as to vow never to retreat from battle.  Their pride
leads them to be touchy about their honor, and they make jests about others
swiftly.  

Sha'mad Conde (Thunder Walkers)
The Sha'mad Conde are fearsome in battle, huge, powerful men of the Aiel.
Although they are considered noisy and slow by their brethren, they are as
swift and deadly as any Aiel.  

Tain Shari (True Bloods)

Duadhe Mahdi'in (Water Seekers)
Masters of finding water almost anywhere, the Duadhe Mahdi'in are usually
the ones who find campsites, and sites for new holds.  Able to survive
virtually anywhere in the Threefold land, they are often solitary men,
sometimes ranging far into the wilderness for periods of time.  
 
Mera'din (the Brotherless)
 Aiel who joined the Shaido - though not of the clan - unwilling to 
aknowledge Rand al'Thor as the Car'a'carn, or unwilling to accept the 
origins of the Aiel.  Denied acceptance in their societies amongst the
Shaido for the act of abandoning sept and clan, they formed their own 
society, the Botherless.

-1 'AIEL WAR'~
AIEL WAR (976-978)

When King Laman (LAY-mahn) of Cairhien cut down Avendoraldera,
four clans of the Aiel crossed the Spine of the World. They looted and
burned the capital city of Cairhien as well as many other cities and
towns, and the conflict extended into Andor and Tear.  By the conventional
view, the Aiel were finally defeated at the Battle of the Shining Walls,
before Tar Valon; in fact, Laman was killed in that battle, and having
done what they came to for, the Aiel recrossed the Spine.

-1 'AIEL WASTE' 'THREE-FOLD LAND'~
AIEL WASTE

Called Djevik K'Shar, "The Dying Ground" in the Trolloc tongue, The
Three-Fold Land (known to outsiders as the Aiel Waste) is a harsh, rugged,
desert land, and home to a harsh, rugged people known as the Aiel.  The Aiel
have established a reputation as the most deadly fighters on the continent
(if not the world).  Tall, strong, and fast, the Aiel are renowned fighters,
and widely feared and mistrusted throughout the rest of the continent.
Veiling their faces before killing, the Aiel refer to fighting as "the Dance
of spears".  They will not touch a sword even on pain of death, and use only
those weapons which have a utilitarian purpose, as well.  Since the Aiel
War, only peddlers, gleemen, and the Tinkers have been allowed to enter the
Waste.

The Aiel are divided into twelve clans, each as large as a small nation.
These clans regularly fight with each other, as nations do, although their
battles are mostly over small oasis.  In turn, these clans are divided into
septs, with no set number of septs for each clan.  In addition, the warrior
class of the Aiel is divided into twelve societies.  These societies span
several clans, and members will not fight other warriors from the same
society, even though they may be of different clans.  For this reason, there
is always communication between clans, even when they are at war with one
another.

One of the Aiel warrior societies is Far Dareis Mai, or the Maidens of the
Spear.  The Maidens of the Spear are female warriors, widely known to be
just as ferocious in battle as their male counterparts.  The Maidens may
bear children, but they may not marry and remain a Maiden.  Upon becoming a
Maiden, the woman is told: "You may belong to no man, nor any man belong to
you, nor any child.  The spear is your lover, your child, and your life."

Despite their reputation for fierce battle, not all Aiel are warriors.
There is a large class of craftsmen, and many Aiel never fight in wars, even
though they are all trained in basic fighting techniques.  In addition,
those women who can channel, and even some who cannot, become Wise Ones.
Those men who are discovered to be able to channel are expected to go into
the Blight to try and kill the Dark One.

Recently, Rand al'Thor has led the Aiel over the Dragonwall and into
Cairhien.  After defeating the rebel Shaido clan, which had laid siege to
the city, those Aiel who followed Rand took control of the city.  They were
also involved in the successful assault Rand, who they call the Car'a'carn
(he who comes with the dawn), against Illian.

0 'AMYRLIN SEAT'~
The woman called the Amyrlin Seat, informally called the Amyrlin, is the
ruler of all Aes Sedai and the White Tower. All Aes Sedai are pledged
to obey her without question. She is called Mother by Tower folk, and
calls them Son, Daughter, or Child in reply. She is of all Ajahs and none,
although her assistant, the Keeper of the Chronicles, is always raised
from the same Ajah. There have been but two Amyrlins from the Red Ajah
before recent times, and both almost destroyed the Tower entirely.

The Amyrlin is most probably one of the most powerful women in the world.
More powerful than any king or queen, the Amyrlin Seat makes many thrones
tremble. NO ONE refuses a summons to the Amyrlin.

The seal of the Amyrlin is the White Flame. The role of this woman is to
watch over the seals on the Dark One's prison, but few remember that, let
alone realize that the location of the seals has been a mystery since the
Trolloc Wars.

-1 'ARAD DOMAN'  'BANDAR EBAN'~
Arad Doman is located just north of the Almoth Plain, and is flanked by the
Aryth Ocean and the Mountains of Mist.  Domani women are known throughout
the continent for their beautiful copper skin and graceful movement.  Domani
girls are taught the art of seduction from childhood, and only Sea Folk
women can outmatch them for sensuous grace.  As it happens, most Domani
merchants are women.  It is very hard to come out ahead when dealing with a
Domani, but most men consider it worth the experience.

The capital city of Arad Doman is Bandar Eban.  Bandar Eban lies on the
Aryth Ocean and Domani merchants trade often with the Sea Folk, selling
their goods to inland consumers.  In addition, Arad Doman trades often with
Tarabon and Saldaea, although trade with Tarabon is often replaced with war
over the disputed Almoth Plain.

51 'AUTOQUEST RULES'~
AutoQuests can be implemented through the use of mob programs.
A few rules:
1) Try to run all AutoQuest ideas thru Phil first, so you don't make this
monstrosity that takes 4 months to write and then I shake my head.
2) One AutoQuest per area.
3) No AutoQuests in Guild Areas.
4) Rewards fall under Stock equipment rules, not Quest Equipment.
5) No inter-area AutoQuests.  They must be self-contained to the area.
6) Objects used in the AutoQuest must be flagged Rotdeath and Nosave.
 
Other rules to come as they are brought to light.

-1 'BAND OF THE RED HAND'~
(1) A legendary band of heroes (Shen an Calhar) from the Trolloc Wars
who died at the Battle of Aemon's Field, when Manetheren fell. (2) A
military formation which gathered to follow Mat Cauthon, and which is
currently shadowing the rebel Aes Sedai and their army with orders to
carry Egwene al'Vere to Rand al'Thor and safety, should she express a wish
to flee from her current situation, and also any other sisters who might
wish to join her.
~

-1 'CADIN'SOR (KAH-dihn-sohr)'~
The garb of the Aiel algai'd'siswai: coat and breeches in browns and
grays that fade into rock or shadow, along with soft, laced knee-high
boots.  In the Old Tongue, "working clothes," though this is of course, an
imprecise translation.
~

-1 'CHILDREN OF THE LIGHT'~
A society of strict aecetic beliefs, owing allegiance to no nation and
dedicated to the defeat of the Dark One and the destruction of all
Darkfriends.  Founded during the War of the Hundred Years to
proselytize against an increase in Darkfriends, they evolved during the
war into a completely military society.  Extremely rigid in beliefs, and
certain that only they know the truth and the right. Consider Aes Sedai
and any who support them to be Darkfriends.  Known disparingly as
Whitecloaks.  Thier sign is a golden sunburst on a field of white.

~

-1 'COLD ROCKS HOLD'~
Cold Rocks Hold is the home of the Taardad Aiel, and is located inside a
huge stone butte somewhere in the Aiel Waste.  A huge fissure runs halfway
down the butte, and inside this fissure live the Aiel.  Houses line the
inside of the fissure, build directly onto and into the cold stone walls.
Families live and farm inside the fissure, raising crops such as corn and
tomatoes.

~

0 'CRITICAL STRIKE'~
Knowledge of the body's key weak points allows someone with the critical
strike skill to find a spot on someone's body where an attack, whether by
fist or by weapon, causes great amounts of damage to the target.  
 
This is a group specific skill: Blademaster, Sam'Dain, Sovin Dore.
~

1 'DARK ONE'~
This is the most common name, used in every land, for Shai'tan: the source
of evil, antithesis of the Creator. Imprisoned by the Creator at the moment
of Creation in a prison in Shayol Ghul. An attempt to free him from this
prison brought about the War of the Shadow, the tainting of saidin, the
Breaking of the World, and the end to the Age of Legends.

0 'DUAL WIELD'~
Dual wielding is a fighting technique found in various cultures of the
world.  While favored by Arafellins and the Aiel, the styles by which they
apply this skill vary.  When wielding two weapons, the number of attacks you
have will double, but you will be unable to use a shield or hold another
object in your hand.  Thus, you gain immense damage potential, but make up
for it in a loss of defense.  Two-handed weapons cannot be wielded using
this skill.  When wielding two weapons, the weight of your primary weapon
must exceed that of your secondary, or the lack of balance will throw the
technique off.  
 
This is a group specific skill: Manshimai, Siswai N'Dore.
~

-1 'EBOU DAR'~
The capital city of Altara.  One of the great ports, and a city with
many odd customs for an outsider to assimilate.
~

-1 'ENHANCED DAMAGE'~
Warriors and skilled thieves can become skilled enough in combat that they are
able to inflict more damage than other classes.  Enhanced damage is checked
for with each hit, although with a low skill, the chance of receiving a bonus
is very low indeed.
~

-1 'FAST HEALING'~
The fast healing skill improves wound healing rates, whether walking,
resting or sleeping.  This skill is represenatative of the players
constitution and stamina.  Fast healing is check every tick, and it is
possible for it to fail.  Perhaps one of those wounds was deeper than you
thought?  The fast healing skill is available to all players, though natural
warriors will prove more enduring than rogues or channelers.  

The constitution attribute is important in both normal healing and the fast
healing bonus.  It is recommended to keep this attribute as close to maxed
as possible to reap the skill's full benefits.  
~

-1 'GROUP HEADER'~
The following skills and groups are available to your character:

~

-1 'GROUPS' 'INFO' 'PREMISE'~
The ROM skill system allows you to fully customize your new character, making
him or her skilled in the skills you choose.  But beware, the skills you pick
at character creation are the only skills you will ever learn.  Skills are
paid for with creation points, and the more creation points you have, the
harder it is to gain a level.  Furthermore, higher-cost skills are harder to
practice.

Skill groups are like package deals for characters -- sets of skills or spells
that are closely related, and hence can be learned as a unit.  There is a
default skill group for each class, which can be selected for a balanced
selection of skills at a somewhat reduced cost.

The experience breakdown is as follows:

points   exp/level     points   exp/level
  40        1000         90        6000 
  50        1500         100       8000
  60        2000         110      12000
  70        3000         120      16000
  80        4000         130      24000

The table continues in a similar manner for higher point totals.

-1 'MOUNTED COMBAT' HEDGE REAR~
These three skills are available only to the Cavalry combat group.  The
skills are described below and only work when the player is mounted on a
steed.  Besides from the normal skill, your Riding skill and Wisdom also
play a part in these skills.  

MOUNTED COMBAT
A warhorse is not only A trained warhorse not only serves well as a steed,
but also as an extension of the warrior mounted and commanding it.  Cavalry
members gain a greater degree of control over their steed and often gain
greater results due to their mounted status, such as Bashing and Kicking.  

HEDGE
One of the principal strengths of the Cavalry is their lightning speed and
reaction time.  As such, using the Hedge command, Cavalry members can hedge
off members of groups, separating them into smaller splinter groups.  A few
cavalrymen can often dispatch of a smaller group easily.  

REAR
The charge of the Cavalry can often break a stalemate The charge of the
Cavalry can often break a stalemated battle or the lines of a defensive
opposition.  Rearing their steed away from their opponents, Cavalry members
can often charge back into combat with impressive results.  If chased after
rearing, the horseman may be too rushed to initiate a proper charge and thus
lose this bonus to attack.

~

-1 'SALDAEA, MARADON'~
The nation of Saldaea is the largest of the Blightborder nations.  Flanked
by the Aryth Ocean and Kandor, it is larger than Shienar and Arafel
combined.  Like all Borderland nations, Saldaea has a strong military
tradition, which is embodied by its cavalry.  The Saldaean cavalry is widely
considered to be the best light cavalry on the continent.  Saldaean
cavalrymen can perform amazing acrobatics atop their chargers, full-speed
dismounts and remounts, flipping, riding upside-down, and more.  Troops of
several thousand cavalrymen can perform complex maneuvers without anyone
falling out of step.

The military nature of Saldaea touches even its women.  The wives of
officers always accompany their husbands on campaigns, with the exception of
those within the Blight.  All women are expected to be knowledgeable in
military affairs and maneuvers, and are usually trained in the usage of
knives and hand-to-hand fighting.

The current ruler of Saldaea is Queen Tenobia, and her uncle Davram Bashere
is the Marshal-General, responsible for defending Saldaea and managing the
military.  The sigil of Saldea is The Three Silver Fish, which consists of
three silver fish, one atop the other.  The Saldaean banner shows three
silver fish on a field of dark blue.  The capital city is Maradon.

-1 'SECOND ATTACK' 'THIRD ATTACK' 'FOURTH ATTACK' 'FIFTH ATTACK'~
'SECOND ATTACK' 'THIRD ATTACK' 'FOURTH ATTACK' 'FIFTH ATTACK'
Second Attack - Available to all.
Third Attack - Available to Rogues and Warriors.
Fourth Attack - Available to Warriors.
Fifth Attack - Group Specific Skill: Blademaster.
 
Different classes learn the art of warfare at different rates, and this
reflects in their speed during combat.  While being trained in an enhanced
attack, the player is NOT guaranteed that many attacks per round- but they
have the potential.  Each attack is successive- if you buy third attack
but not second, you will not get three attacks, only two.  Each successive
attack increases the chances of the next.
~

0 'SHIELD BLOCK'~
Anyone can wear a shield but one skilled in a shield's usage is much more
effective at blocking attacks, while keeping the extra weight from hampering
offensive abilities.  
~

-1 'TAR VALON'~
Tar Valon is an island city located on the River Erinin, between the
Borderlands to the north and the kingdoms of the south.  The Ogier-built
houses, palaces, and towers which grace the city attract many visitors every
year, of every nationality.  Tar Valon is approximately three to four miles
across, and most of that space is dedicated to parks and gardens.  There are
two harbors in the city, one on the northern tip of the island, the other on
the southern tip.  The White Tower, the center of the power of the Aes
Sedai, dominates the center of the city, and, indeed, a council of Aes Sedai
is responsible for the ruling of the city.  Representatives of every nation
live and work within the walls of Tar Valon, mostly dealing either in trade
or with the Aes Sedai.  Since it was established in 98 AB, the city has
never fallen to invaders, and has seldom been attacked.  This is partially
due to the fact that the island can only be reached by crossing long,
Ogier-built bridges, or by boat, but is mostly because of the hundreds of
Aes Sedai in the White Tower at any one time.

~

1 'THE BLEAKNESS' BLEAKNESS~
The Bleakness is a term given by the Aiel to a sickness caused by learning
that rather than having always been fierce warriors, their ancestors were
strict pacifists forced into defending themselves during the Breaking of the
World and the years following. This knowledge os revealed at Rhuidean, to the
select few who journey there. Many feel that this was their failure of the
Aes Sedai. Some of those effected by the Bleakness throw down their spears
and run away, never to be seen again. Others refuse to put off the gai'shain
white when their time is up. Still others deny the truth of this, and with
it deny necessarily that Rand al'Thor is the Car'a'carn; these either return
to the Aiel Waste or join the Shaido clan opposing him.

See also AIEL, GAI`SHAIN, RHUIDEAN~

0 'THREE OATHS'~
When raised to an Accepted, these Oaths are made when holding the Oath Rod,
which binds them to keep the Oath as firmly as their skin keeps their
insides in.

1. To speak no word that is not true.

2. To make no weapon for one man to kill another.

3. Never to use the One Power as a weapon except against Darkfriends or
Shadowspawn, or in the last extreme of defending her own life, that of her
Warder, or that of another Sister.


The First Oath is often weaseled around by the Aes Sedai. This is probably
why there is a saying: "The truth an Aes Sedai speaks is not always the
truth you think it is". It was not always necessary to swear oaths, when
people knew what the Aes Sedai stood for. But it became necessary to calm
the nations' fear of them using the Power as a weapon against them.

~

0 'TIME OF MADNESS'~
Though Lews Therin and his Hundred Companions were successful in
the Sealing of the Bore, their actions unwittingly led to a greater
disaster than anything that had occurred during the War of the Shadow
known also as the War of the Power.  At the moment of the sealing of
the Dark One into his prison, a "backblast" tainted the male half of
the One Power, saidin, even as the Companions were drawing upon
it. It is not certain if this was a desperate action by the Dark One
or simply a consequence of his efforts to prevent the Bore from being
sealed.  This "backblast" led to the greatest calamity the world that has
been recorded, the Breaking of the World.

Lews Therin along with the surviving members of the Hundred
Companions, went instantly insane after the "backblast", and perhaps
never knew that their attempt to seal the Bore had been successful.
These insane male Aes Sedai armed with the One Power, began
unleashing an onslaught with the One Power, against anything and
anyone that crossed their path or even caught their attention.  Trails of
wanton destruction and death, were left behind.

Until that point in time, the One Power had never before been used in such
a violent and insane manner.  The minds of all the surviving Companions
were twisted by the taint into having dreams of madness, and saidin
gave them the power to make these dreams an instant reality. The most
notable of these, was the leader of the Hundred Companions, Lews
Therin (also remembered as the Dragon).  He became remembered as
Lews Therin "Kinslayer" for having not only wreaked vast devastation
upon the land, but also killed every living person who carried any of his
blood, as well as everyone he loved.  The individual acts of destruction
by most of the Companions may have never been recorded, save that they
were known to be on a scale the likes of which had never been known.

Lews Therin and his Hundred Companions were not the only ones
affected by the backlash that was the result of the Sealing of the
Bore.  Other male Aes Sedai who touched on the True Source for
various matters, were also affected by the taint and resulting madness.
These male Aes Sedai, unlike the Companions, were not affected
instantly.  Some time passed before these men began to go insane. Over
time more and more male Aes Sedai were succumbing to the madness,
creating upheaval with the world before their inevitable death, and as
their numbers increased, chaos increased along with them, and civilization
itself deteriorated.

The Breaking of the World, a result of this Time of Madness, put an
end to the War of the Shadow, and is believed to have lasted between
239 to 344 years. Survival, and not war became the focus of both sides.
During the worst of the Time of Madness, mad male Aes Sedai, who could
wield the One Power to a degree now unknown, caused the weather to
protest, resulting in storms of unimaginable fury that shook the world.
Volcanos erupted violently and these male Aes Sedai, in the grips of
their madness, leveled mountains, raised new mountains, and lifted sea
floors resulting in flooding dry land. The earth trembled and seas boiled.

The results were crumbled cities, with their once prosperous inhabitants
scattering to search for safety in the world of madness. Some male Aes
Sedai had sought shelter in Ogier steddings, where the Power did not
work and the True Source could not be sensed.  But by the end of the
Breaking, all the male Aes Sedai that had sheltered in the
stedding had left. Nearly three centuries later, the death of the last
male Aes Sedai marked the end of the Time of Madness and the
Breaking of the World, but most of the land's civilizations were
reduced to the most primitive nomadic levels, even after the climate and
geologic fabric of the earth settled into a normalcy. A few groups,
however, managed to keep some hold on their traditions and culture.

0 'WHEEL OF TIME'~
WHEEL OF TIME

Wheel of Time (WoT) is a fantasy book series by Robert Jordan (RJ) that this
mud is based on. This series of 8 books includes many things that do not
exist in "the real world", such as Trollocs, Fades, and Forsaken. These
books are amazingly intricately done, with many details that would take
Ages to explain to someone that has not read the series. If you wish to
know the basics, explore the MUD, talk to people, and try your best
to get a copy of the WoT series!

This mud has been built in accordance to this fantasy world, so that people
may enter and "live" the books, to have FUN. Please remember that as you

-1 A'DAM ADAM~
A'DAM (AYE-dam)

A device for controlling a woman who can channel, usable only by
either a woman who can channel, or one who can be taught to channel,
and having no effect on any woman who cannot channel.  It creates a link
between the two women.  The Seanchan version consists of a collar and
bracelet connected by a leash, all of silvery metal, but one example of a
version without the leash has been made, and another, unique, variant is
believed to exist which allows a woman to control a man who can channel.
If such a man is linked by an ordinary a'dam to a woman who can channel,
the likely result is death for both.  When an a'dam is worn by a woman who
can channel, simply touching the a'dam results in pain for a man who also
can. 
 
  See also LINKING, SEANCHAN.
~

0 ABILITY RATING~
The total ability rating in each sphere is totaled to determine your
total ability.  When channeling, other channelers of the same sex can feel
your strength (your ability rating) in comparison to their own.  For men,
this only occurs if both are seizing the True Source.  In some groups, like
the Aes Sedai, your ability is one of the factors that determines your
status.  The higher your ability, the higher your status.

-1 AFK~
AFK (Away From Keyboard)
Syntax: afk

Typing AFK puts your character in a tell-saving mode as follows: any tell to
you is stored in a special buffer, and can be seen later by typing replay.
This is useful when you need to leave the mud for 5 or 10 minutes, but don't
want to miss tells.  AFK shows up in your prompt until it is turned off.

Tells to link-dead players are stored in a similar fashion, and can also be
seen by typing replay (unless, of course, the character logs off before
reading them).

-1 AJAH~
AJAH (AH-jah)

  Societies among the Aes Sedai, seven in number and designated by
colors: Blue, Red, White, Green, Brown, Yellow and Gray.  All Aes Sedai
except the Amyrlin Seat belong to one.  Each follows a specific
philosophy of the use of the One Power and the purposes of the Aes Sedai.
The Red Ajah bends it's energies to finding men who can channel, and to
gentling them.  The Brown forsakes the mundane world and dedicates itself to
seeking knowledge, while the White, largely eschewing both the world and the
value of worldly knowledge, devotes itself to questions of philosophy and
truth. The Green Ajah (called the Battle Ajah during the Trolloc Wars)
holds itself ready for Tarmon Gai'don, the Yellow concentrates on the
study of Healing, and the Blue sisters involve themselves with causes and
justice.  The Gray are mediators, seeking harmony and consensus.  A Black
Ajah, dedicated to serving the Dark One is officially and vehemently
denied.

-1 ALGAI'D'SISWAI~
ALGAI'D'SISWAI

In the Old Tounge, "fighters of the spear," or "spear fighters."  The name
given to those Aiel who carry the spear and regularly take part in
battle, as opposed to those who follow crafts.

~

-1 ALIAS UNALIAS~
ALIAS, UNALIAS
Syntax: alias
	alias <word>
	alias <word> <substitution>
	unalias <word>

The alias command allows limited shortening of command names.  At this time,
aliases cannot call other aliases, and cannot generate more than one
command. Alias by itself lists your current aliases, Alias <word> lists the
alias with that name (if such exist), and alias with both a word and and
argument produces a new alias.  You cannot alias either alias or unalias to
a new command.  Examples of use:

alias gc get all corpse --> typing gc will equal typing 'get all corpse'
alias ff cast 'fireball' --> ff orc will equal 'cast 'fireball' orc'

Only the first word on the line will be subsituted at this time.

58 ALLOW BAN PERMBAN~
ALLOW, BAN, PERMBAN
Syntax: allow  <site>
	ban/permban    <site> <newbies|all|permit>
	ban/permban

BAN <site> prohibits players from that site from logging in.  BAN with
no arguments lists the banned sites.  

ALLOW <site> removes a site from the ban list, if the remover is of equal 
or higher level than the banner.

A site may have all players, new players, or non-permitted players 
(set by editing the player file) banned, by changing the argument 
after the site. *'s may be used to ban either by suffix (*.edu), prefix 
(labmac*), or content (*andrews*), but be careful not to accidently lock
out too many sites with a wildcard.  Bans do not save unless the permban
command is used. Many muds permban *sfpl.ca* by default because of the
amount of known troublemakers and hackers that come from that site.
Below is an example of a banned sites list. Temp on the ban list mans the
ban will be automatically removed the next reboot of the mud.

Banned sites  level  type     status
*sfpl.ca*       60   all      perm

-1 ALTARA, 'EBOU DAR'~
ALTARA, EBOU DAR

Altara is a nation facing the Sea of Storms and flanked by both Amadicia and
Illian.  Had it not been for Illian's support during the Whitecloak War,
Altara would likely be under the control of Amadicia.  Indeed, Altara is
easy prey for outside attacks, due to the lack of unity within its borders.
The Queen, Tylin Quintara of House Mitsobar, has had great difficulty in
exerting influence over her people, and was in control of little more than a
one-hundred mile radius surrounding the capital, Ebou Dar.  Unfortunately,
what little power she has gained was swept aside in the recent Seanchan
invasion of Ebou Dar, and it remains to be seen whether the fragmentary
nobles of Altara can fend off the invaders.

Ebou Dar is a city of white buildings and palaces, along with some less
savory aspects.  The city of Ebou Dar straddles the River Eldar, with one
side containing the homes of the upper and middle class, as well as numerous
palaces with turnip-shaped domes.  Canals and roads criss-cross under
white-plastered buildings, and small shops often nestle up closely to large
palaces.  On the other side of the river, the dwellings of the lower class
sprawl out to form a part of the city known as the Rahad.  Duels are a
normal part of Altaran life, and Ebou Dar is no exception.  In the Rahad,
duels happen almost hourly.  However, many do not bother with the formality
of a duel, and simply stab their victim in the back.  On the other side of
the river, people are generally quite polite, and most do not look for
duels, but rather, accept them as they come along.

The sigil of Altara consists of two golden leopards, one above the other.
The banner shows the Golden Leopards on a field checked four-by-four in red
and blue, with red next to the staff on the topmost row.  Currently, the
Seanchan rule the city of Ebou Dar.

~

-1 ANDOR, CAEMLYN, WHITEBRIDGE, FOUR KINGS, TWO RIVERS~
Andor is by far the largest nation on the continent, as well as one of the
oldest.  Its royal line can trace its lineage back to before the time of
Artur Hawkwing, and the nation itself has been in existence since his death.
The ruler of Andor is always a Queen, and the Queen's eldest brother (or,
the First Prince, if she has no brother) is called the First Prince of the
Sword, and is responsible for the protection of the Queen and the command of
the armies.  The daughter of the Queen is always sent to the White Tower for
instruction (no matter whether she can channel or not), and all of the
Queens of Andor have had Aes Sedai advisors, a tradition which was started
at the very beginning of Andor's nationhood.  Andor has a robust economy
built upon its exports of grain, wool, tabac, precious metals, and ironwork.
Because of a decrease in population over the past few hundred years, much of
Andor is beyond the Queen's control.

Caemlyn is second only to Tar Valon in its beauty.  Resting on low hills in
the east of Andor, it boasts some of the finest Ogier stonework in the
world.  The Inner City glistens with beautiful white towers and domes, and
is surrounded by a huge, shining, white wall.  The New City, built by man
alone, is a glistening jewel in itself, and possesses many domed palaces and
fine houses.  An enormous fifty-foot wall, broken by large towers and arched
gates, encloses the New City, but houses cluster around the wall and
gradually spread outward from the city.  Caemlyn possesses an excellent
library, second only to the White Tower and Royal libraries of Tar Valon and
Cairhien.

Whitebridge is perhaps the second-best known town in Andor.  This is
partially due to the huge white bridge which spans the River Arinelle.  The
bridge is the only bridge south of Maradon in Saldaea which crosses the
Arinelle, and so, the town of Whitebridge thrives on trade.  The bridge is
believed to have been constructed during the Age of Legends, and it appears
to be made of fragile white glass.  However, the bridge cannot be scratched
by even the strongest of blows with a hammer, and it never becomes slick,
even when wet.  The town of Whitebridge sprung up around the stone-paved
square at the eastern foot of the bridge, and is home to many shops and
inns.  In addition, many ships stop to trade and to take on provisions in
the town.

Four Kings is a trading town on the Caemlyn Road between Whitebridge and
Caemlyn.  It acts as a trading hub between Caemlyn, Whitebridge, and
Murandy.  Consequently, most of the buildings in the town are inns and
stables.

The Two Rivers is one of the neglected parts of Andor.  Few of the local
inhabitants know that they are ruled by a Queen (or even part of Andor), and
still fewer care.  They are inordinately stubborn and independent, and have
been known to be extremely resilient in the face of hardships.  The majority
of the residents are farmers, producing the finest tabac and wool on the
continent.  Due to the seclusion of the Two Rivers, there are very few
merchants, and only a small number of inns.

The sigil of Andor is a rampant white lion.  The banner consits of the White
Lion on a field of red.  Rand al'Thor is the current ruler of Andor,
although he has promised to transfer rule to the rightful heir to the
throne, Elayne Trakand, upon her return to Caemlyn.

-1 ANGREAL~
ANGREAL

Remnants of the Age of Legends that allow anyone capable of channeling
to handle a greater amount of the One Power than is safe or even
possible unaided.  Some were made for use by women, others by men.  Rumors
of angreal usable by both men and women have never been confirmed.  Their
making is no longer known, and few are known to remain in existance.

-1 ARAFEL, 'SHOL ARBELA'~
Arafel lies to the west of Shienar and is made up of rougher country than
Shienar.  Natives of Arafel are pale-skinned with unusually large eyes.
Arafellin men wear their hair in two braids down their back, with silver
bells on the ends.  Like all Borderlanders, Arafel has a strong military
tradition.  All Arafellin warriors are trained to wield two swords at once,
and are highly skilled fighters.

0 ARCHETYPE~
This file is designed to help explain this mud's vision
on certain questions regarding sensitive RP issues.
These issues have been questioned by many, and we have
lost good friends due to my standing on these decisions.
But these stand.
 
Female Sei'Cair- Although we have never
SEEN a female wolfkin, it has never been said that
women cannot be attuned to the wolves.  It is the belief
of this mud that even the references of man to the wolves have
all been made as "mankind", which is to mean men and women.
So there can be male and female Sei'Cair.
 
Channelling Sie'Cair-  Okay, wolfkin and channellers
are two different animals, right?  Right.  And the
chances of becoming a channeler are reeeeallly small,
right?  And the chances of becoming a wolfkin are 
reeeeeaallly small, right?  So the chances of a wolfkin
channeler would be reeeeealllly reeeeaaaalllly small,
right?  Like 1 or 2 in 10k- 100k?  Fine.  It can
happen.  Once.  Usul Kentel.  The ONLY one we will
accept.  So no channeling wolfkin.
 
Ogier Hailene-  It is written that the Ogier are the most 
feared of the Empress' Deathwatch.  No Ogier have been
seen in the Hailene, and it would doubted that such
resources would be wasted taking back what the Oathbreaker's
have stolen.  Better they be spent protecting the Empress or
warding the Lesser Blight.  No Ogier Hailene.
 
Channelling Male Aiel- You may play a Channelling Male Aiel
if you wish, but you should be prepared that anytime after level 15
a member of Council may arbitrarily send you a pmote saying you decide
to die an honorable death by venturing into the Blight, thus being DELETED
and having that character's name RESTRICTED.  Ooh, we're mean.

Female Gaidin-  While seen as a boys club and unfair
to not allow female membership, that is the way it will
stand.  No female Gaidin.  If it is a boy's club, it is
that way because Jordan wrote it that way- not because
we are sexist and want to keep women out.  There has
been one mentioned female Warder, Birgitte.  So it IS
possible, it is just not done.  Please see below:
++"The Fires of Heaven, Ripped Away.  Page 399
'I can do something that might help,' Elayne said
slowly.  You were supposed to have permission, but it
had not always been so.  Once it had been done almost
as often without as with.  THERE WAS NO REASON IT
SHOULD NOT WORK ON A WOMAN.  EXCEPT THAT
SHE HAD NEVER HEARD OF IT BEING DONE TO ANY BUT MEN"
Accepted are taught the reason behind the failure of 
the Sedai that caused, the fall of Malkier.  They are
incredibly well versed in Tower politics.  They would
know.
++"The Fires of Heaven, A New Name.  Page 409
'A Warder,' Birgitte said slowly.  'I think I remember
hearing a tale of a female Warder, but it was in a life
so long ago that I cannot  remember more than that."
Since Birgitte can remember back to the Age of Legends
before there was Bonding and Warders, it is this mud's
conjecture that the tale she THINKS SHE REMEMBERS
hearing is actually a tale of herself, from a different
turning of the Wheel.  
There will be no female Gaidin, save Birgitte.

-1 ASHA'MAN ASHAMAN~
ASHA'MAN

(1) In the Old Tounge, "Guardian" or "Defender", with a strong implication
that this is a defender of truth and justice.

(2) The name taken by followers of the Dragon Reborn, men who have come
to what is now being called The Black Tower in order to learn how to
channel.

  Some have dreamed of channeling despite all the dire risks, while others
have remained only because passing the test for the ability to learn has
itself started them on the road to channeling, and they now must learn to
control it before it kills them.  They train not only in the One Power, but
in the use of the sword and in fighting with hands and feet.  The Asha'man,
who wear distinctive black coats, are divided according to the level of
knowledge they have achieved, the lowest being a Soldier, the next level is
a Dedicated, marked by a pin in the shape of a silver sword worn on the coat
collar. The Highest level is called simply an Asha'man, marked by a
red-and-gold enamled pin in the shape of a Dragon worn on the coat collar
opposite the silver sword.

  Unlike Aes Sedai who go to great lengths to make sure that those they
train are not allowed to move dangerously fast, the Asha'man are pushed hard
from the beginning, most especially in learning to use the One Power as a
weapon.  As a result, where the death or stilling of a novice of the White
Tower during her training would be something spoken of with horror for
years, at the Black Tower it is expected that a certain number of Asha'man
Soldiers will die or be burned out attempting to learn.  The existance of
the Asha'man, and their connection to the Dragon Reborn, has caused a
reevaluation among some Aes Sedai of the immediate necessity for gentling,
but many have not changed their view at all. See also gentling and
stilling.

-1 ASSASSIN~
Cost: Rogue (80)

One of the most dubious character arch-types offered, most people tend to
avoid assassin characters once they're discovered, simply on the fact that
they are very difficult to trust.  The quickest way to get to a targets back
is a winsome smile and the fine veil of sincerity. Popular in the circles of
Daes'Damar, assassins are often sent under the guise of Gleemen- and though
one of the more abvious gambits to employ, it is also considered
disrespectful to deny such a gift. Characters studying under this group will
gain the following skills (upon level requirements):

[0 ] backstab
[1 ] circle
[2 ] envenom
[3 ] hide
[4 ] dirt kick
[5 ] enhanced damage
[6 ] second attack
[7 ] third attack
[8 ] envenom

0 ASTAT~
ASTAT
Syntax: astat

This command gives you a listing of all the areas along with their vnums
assigned, and how many rooms, objects, and mobs have been created in each
area. A total is also included of how many rooms, objects, and mobs there
are created.

  See also ALIST.
~

54 AT~
Syntax: at <location>/<player> <command>

At executes the given command or social (which may have arguments) at the
given location.  The location may be specified as a vnum, as the name of
a mobile/player, or as the name of an object.

At works by temporarily moving you to that location, executing the
command, and then moving you back to your starting location 
(if the command didn't change your location).

0 ATTRIBUTES STRENGTH WISDOM INTELLIGENCE DEXTERITY CONSTITUTION~
ATTRIBUTES make up the statistical data of your character.  They are a
measure of who he/ she is or was, and are important in gameplay.  Here is a
list of you character's attributes, and a brief description as to how they
relate to the game.  
 
STRENGTH is a measure of the physical prowess your character posseses.
Characters with a higher strength hit harder and can carry heavier items.
 
INTELLIGENCE is a statistic that defines your knowledge into the world
at large and how you handle learning new things.  Characters with a
higher intelligence tend to learn quicker when practicing their skills.
 
WISDOM is different than intelligence as it relates to how perceptive
you are of the world around you and your judgement of the events  that
make up your life.  Characters with a high wisdom score gain more
practices per level than those with a lower score.
 
DEXTERITY is a measure of how quick and nimble your character is.  It
gauges how hard you are to hit in combat and how many items you can
hold at a single time.
 
CONSTITUTION is the stamina and vatality of your character.  It helps
in resistance to disease and poison, and higher constitution scores
grant a bonus to hit point rolls at each level.

0 AUCTION~

Syntax

show 
Defaults to detail of last item bid on, or all if no bids. You can use any
of the following arguments with the show command.

	#       Show detail of the specified item
	detail  Show detail for all items (default is summary)
        bids    Show detail for all items currently bidding on
        winning Show detail for all items currently winning bids on
        losing  Show detail for all items currently losing bids on
        'name'  Show all auctions by a specific person (detail)
        all     Show summary of all auctions (default action)


sell <item> <opening amount>
Put an item up for auction
You can use any of the following arguments with the sell command.

        reserve Set the reserve price, if any
        open    Set the opening bid
        inc     Set the minimum bid increment
        commit  Commit the item to sale

Note that until you use the 'auction sell commit' command sequence, your
item will not go up for auction.  Once you commit to the auction, the item
is removed from your inventory and placed on the auction block.

Some examples;

  auction sell "uber sword" 1000
  --This will start the auction process for the item 'uber sword' and
  set the opening price (change with the auction sell open) to 1000 gold.

  auction inc 100
  --With your auction started now, this command will set the 'minimum bid
  increment' value to 100 gold.

  auction reserve 5000
  --This will set the minimum purchase price of your 'uber sword'. If no bids
  reach this minimum, the item will not be sold.

  auction commit
  --Will commit you to the sale of the 'uber sword' and place the auction on
  the block.


bid <#> <amt>
Use the bid command to place a bid on the item you want to buy. You must
include the auction # in your bid, and the amount of the bid must be higher
(by at least the auctions 'inc' value) than the last bid.

cancel/stop
Stop an auction process that you have begun, but not yet 'committed' to.

How to read the auction screen...

Here is an example output from the auction of a basic sword that can be
found anywhere in the mud.

//------------------------------------------------------------------------//
// 2   Rhuarc          a broad sword                             O:  1000 //
// -R- 0   No Winners yet                               M:  1000 H:     0 //
//------------------------------------------------------------------------//

 The '2' on the first line is the Auction ID#. This is the number you need
to bid on this item.  The next bit, "Rhuarc" is the name of the seller. "a
broad sword" is the short description of the item being sold.  'O: 1000' is
the 'Opening price', set to 1000 gold. The next line shows first, '-R-',
these are the flags for this item. The possible flags are QRG. These stand
for;

 Q == This item is a quest item
 R == This item has a reserve price
 G == You dont have enough gold on you to bid on this item.

  The "No Winners yet" will be replaced with the current highest bidders
  name.  "M: 1000" shows the minimum bid needed to bid on this item, and "H:
  0" shows the highest bid received so far.

 Using 'auction show detail' will give much more detail about the item in
 question.

-1 BACKSTAB~
BACKSTAB Syntax: backstab <target>

Backstab is the favored attack of thieves, murderers, and other rogues.  
Your character must be sneaking or hidden in order to backstab his prey.
It can be used with any weapon type, but is most effective with piercing
weapons.  A rogue may only backstab with a weapon of a light weight,
otherwise it becomes too unwieldly for such a precision strike.  Weapons
wielded with two hands cannot be used to backstab.  The damage inflicted by
a backstab is determined by the attacker's level, his weapon skill, his
backstab skill, and the power of his opponent.  Players who chose the
Assassin group also do excessive damage with backstab.  Only rogues may
learn to backstab.  

See also ROGUE.

56 BALEFIRE~
BALEFIRE
Syntax: balefire
        balefire <character>

Used to clean up the world.  Balefire, with no arguments removes all the
NPC's and objects in the current room.  With an argument, it purges one
character from anywhere in the world.

Balefire will not get rid pc characters, objects or mobiles with a
NOPURGE flag set (i.e. the pit, the fountain, or shopkeepers). 
Mobiles may be purged if they are called directly by name.

0 BANK SHARES ECONOMY~
BANK
Syntax:
bank convert
bank deposit
bank withdraw
bank balance
bank transfer
bank buy        <# of shares>
bank sell       <# of shares>
bank check

The Mythran mud bank system enhances the economy of the MUD. In a bank you
can deposit money to your account, withdraw money from it, check your current
bank balance, and transfer money to other players. This can be usefull if you
have to pay your fee for the clan or divide the cash from your quest among
eachother.

Another feature of the bank is that you can buy and sell shares. By buying
shares you can invest your money in the mud economy. The shares constantly
change in value, so you can make a nice profit if you buy and sell your
shares at the right times. The current share price and be seen by going to
the bank, or by checking your score.

-1 BARD~
Cost: Rogue (50)

The jack-of-all-trades and master of none, Bards generally make their way in
life by learning a bit of everything.  Dabbling in politics, combat,
story-telling, histories, bards are the perennial entertainers of the age.
The more successful Gleemen of the realms have started from such beginnings,
as you cannot truly spin a tale of life unless you have lived it. 
Characters studying under this group will gain the following skills (upon
level requirements):

[0 ] backstab
[1 ] second attack
[3 ] lore
[4 ] read
[6 ] parry
~

-1 BASH~
BASH
Syntax: bash

The bash skill is a warrior talent, a brute-force attack designed to knock
your foe to his knees.  Its success depends on many factors, including the
generally a wise idea.  Skill rating, your size, your opponent's size and
your constitution.  Humans bashing Ogier is not generally a wise idea.  

See also WARRIOR.  
~

-1 BASICS~
The basic skills:

Every character starts with two skill groups, one for their class and a default
set that all characters receive.  The default skills are:

recall  	essential escape skill (see help recall)

for class defaults, check the classes themselves.
~

-1 BERSERK~
BERSERK
Syntax: berserk

Only powerful warriors can master berserking, the ability to enter insane rage
in combat.  Its effects are not altogether unlike the frenzy spell -- a huge
surge of combat prowess, coupled with a disregard for personal safety.
Berserking warriors are more resistant to the effects of magic.
~

-1 BLADEMASTER~
While anyone can wield a sword, and most are trained, and some know the
basics Forms, the Blademaster has forsaken all else in his quest to master

-1 BLIGHTWATCH_GUILD~
`NBli`YghtWa`Ntch`w

Rather than a "guild", the BlightWatch instead represents the full might of
the Borderlander armies acting in concert for mutual survival and honor. 
Food, supplies, horses, men, refugees..  All these and more are passed back
and forth between Saldaea, Arafel, Kandor, and Shienar.  Each of these lands
have their own laws and traditions, but all band together to keep the tides
of Shadowspawn from overrunning their homelands, and flowing south in a
unabating wave of carnage and destruction.  At the last Ingathering of the
Lances, Agelmar Jagad was anoited as the Warlord of the Blightwatch.  Since
that time, the following requirements have been posted at the gates of every
border-town.  

1)Male only: In the Borderlands, women are zealously protected by their men.
For example, in Shienar, women are safe no matter where they go or when. 
Even the fiery Saldaean women are kept from batle by their husbands.  

2) Level 15: We expect you to have some measure of skill with the sword
before joining the ranks.  

3) Borderlander only: Only men from Kandor, Shienar, Saldaea or Arafel
willbe allowed into the ranks.  On occasion, Southlanders who prove a
measure of honor and dedication sufficient to the task at hand may be
allowed to join, but this is by no means a certainty.  

4) Warrior and Rogues only: The Borderlands keep the Pact with the White
Tower, and any channelers will be sent to the Tower for Gentling.  

5) Tithe: We are not supported by the fat banks of the south.  We stand
alone.  As such, if a fellow member of the Blightwatch asks for assistance
of any kind (i.e. coin or combat) you must give it.  We have only ourselves
to rely upon.  

6) Your duties are to the Borderlands.  As such, members are expected to
stay in them.  If a journey south must be undertaken, permission must be
attained from the current Warlord.  Embarking without permission is grounds
for demotion or expulsion.  

7) No matter where you go, women must ALWAYS be protected and Shadowspawn
must always be put down.  There is never any excuse to break this rule.  To
break this rule is to dishonor all Borderlanders, and to earn yourself a
booting from the ranks.  

8) ROLEPLAY: This is, of course, the most important rule.  If you cannot;
roleplay the proper Borderlander attitude, you will not gain a position. ;
Any current Blightwatch member should be available to assist with roleplay
questions.  In addition, each individual country has their own quirks and
customs.  Your knowledge of these, but especially the customs of the
nationality you have chosen to play, will be tested both formally and
informally, at every opportunity.  

To apply, send an IC note to 'Blightwatch' and 'Agelmar', detailing your
history, personality, and reasons for joining.  Send this note by level 10,
so you may be watched and guided till level 15.  

May Peace Favor your Sword

-1 BOOK_CHARACTER~
BOOK CHARACTERS
 
Simply put, the term "Book Characters" refer to any major character
from Robert Jordan's 'Wheel of Time' series.  Examples include Lan
Mandragoran, Moiraine Damodred, Rand al'Thor, Siuan Sanche, Min, etc.
Book characters and book character names are typically reserved for
players who fulfill the appropriate criteria (see below).  As a general
rule and warning, any person who generates a character from the book
without prior Council approval will be asked to either rename or
recreate.
Anyone wishing to role-play a character from the books can fill out an
application at <insertpageaddyhere>.  However, the following should be 
noted:  Book characters play a CRUCIAL role to the over-all well being
of the mud's role play.  All book characters MUST adhere strictly to
that characters parameters, as written by Robert Jordan.  Every gesture,
ideology, personality, appearance, history, mannerisms, and equipment
must be accurate.  There is no margin for error, and no margin for
excuses.
Book characters seen on the mud ARE the characters written of in the
novels.  Indeed, a book characters Role Play MUST accurately coincide
with the current MUD timeline.  This is not optional.
All book characters seen are an honor.  In a MUD setting designed
specifically to facillitate an interactive immersion in Robert Jordan's 
world through roleplay, the players of Book Characters should be
considered the elite.  
 
Any questions, please contact your nearest Council Member.

0 BOW ARROW QUIVER LODGE DISLODGE~
Bows have been the preferred weapons of both hunters and assassins for a
number of years.  Being a long-range weapon, one is often hindered entering
combat wielding a bow, but can attack at a distance in relative safety.  
 
To use a bow, you must be wielding one, as well as wearing a quiver with
arrows left in it over your shoulder.  Most quivers only tell you the
maximum arrows they can hold (OBJprogs on the way to fix this slight),
so you will have to keep a tally upon how many you use from that total.
The command to shoot the bow is "fire", and your target MUST be in
an adjacent room to you, with no barriers (ie, doors) separating you.
 
You must not have anything in the 'held' wear position.

Once shot by an bow, you will find an arrow lodged into you.  To
remove the arrow, you will need to "dislodge" it.  Be careful, this is
often QUITE painful.
~

-1 BRAWL 'HAND TO HAND'~
BRAWL

Brawling is a skill commonly used by street-toughs or warriors who are
forced to fight unarmed.  Being skilled in brawl gives one a better attack
when fighting without a weapon than someone unpracticed in it.  

HAND TO HAND

A deadly form of unarmed combat.  Brought across the Waste by the Aiel, this
fighting style is making it's way among the people west of the Dragon Wall. 
It is a more advanced and civilized fighting style than brawling, but it is
also more difficult to master.  Being proficient in this art allows you
attempts at feats generally only accomplishable by those armed with weapons.
This includes parrying and disarming.  You become, in fact, a living weapon.

Players of the Sovin'Dore group gain what is called "Sha'mad Harad" (Thunder
Fist) when they reach the pinnacle of their attacks.  When each blow in a
combat round lands, the final hit does so for excessive damage and can stun
their opponent.  
 
Hand to Hand is a group specific skill: Sovin'Dore, Siswai'N'Dore
 
** This skill is undergoing heavy tweaking.

51 BUILDING_RULES~
Thank you for choosing to help contribute to the Wheel of Time Mud-base.  In
this short chapter, we will cover a few of the basic rules we try to follow
for mud consistancy.

1)  Do NOT use the word "YOU" or any form of it in room descriptions.  Rooms
should not be interactive with players, they should be independant.

2)  Do not use colors in STOCK rooms, objects, or mobs. Yes, pretty flowers
would look nice in color- no, you still should not build in color.  Save
Color for QUEST and GUILD equipment.

3)  The length of a room description should be at least four lines.  Four
lines is not a lot- creative builders can easily fill a room with a dozen
lines.  Concentrate on all the sense, not just what players see- what scents
linger in the air?  What type of ambiance pervades the room?  What can be
seen to the north, south, east or west?

4)  Common Sense.  Use it- its your best tool aside your imagination.
Trollocs are not newbie mobs.  Biteme's should not be able to kill a Warder.
When building, consider the level of whatever you are working on compared to
how it would realistically hold up in real life.

5) Try to build each area with a sense of timelessness.  By this it
It is meant to avoid mentioning different facets of storyline
included in the running storyline (ie, book 1 +).  The reason
for this is, since this is a mud base, individual muds will be
able to declare their own time-frame.  Time based areas (ie, 
Dumai's Well, the Black Tower, Salidar, etc.) will be toggleable,
as will the Guilds, and might not be offered in the original
release but rather in supplemental downloads.

0 BUTCHER~

there is is something to eat.

0 BUY LIST SELL VALUE SHOP~
BUY, LIST, SELL, VALUE
Syntax: buy   <object>
Syntax: list
Syntax: sell  <object>
Syntax: value <object>

BUY buys an object from a shop keeper.
When multiple items of the same name are listed, type 'buy n.item', where n
is the position of the item in a list of that name.  So if there are two
swords, buy 2.sword will buy the second. If you want to buy multiples of
an item, use an * (buy 5*pie will buy 5 pies).  These can be combined into
(for example) buy 2*2.shield, as long as the * is first.

LIST lists the objects the shop keeper will sell you.
List <name> shows you only objects of that name.

SELL sells an object to a shop keeper.

VALUE asks the shop keeper how much he, she, or it will buy the item for.

0 CALENDAR FEASTDAYS~
CALENDAR

  The modern calendar is the Farede Callendar, which sets the first
year of the New Era after the War of the Hundred Years.

  The Farede Calendar has 10 days per week, 28 days per month, and
13 months per year.  These months are Taisham, Jumara, Saban, Aine,
Adar, Saven, Amadaine, Tammaz, Maigdhal, Choren, Shaldine, Nesan,
and Danu.

  Most people, however, reckon time by seasons and the dates of
feastdays.  Many such feastdays are not a part of any month.
These include Sunday, The Feast of Thanksgiving, and the Feast
of All Souls' Salvation (otherwise known as All Souls' Day).

  Feastdays are generally considered as a time of festivity and
celebration, as well as a day off from the toil of everyday life.
There are too many local feastdays to be listed here, but some of the
more widely celebrated and best-known can be found below:

The Feast of Lights-  This feast falls on the last day of Danu (the
   shortest day of the year) and the first day of Taisham.  In some
   places the second day of the festival (the first day of the year)
   is considered a good time to give charity.  In Cairhien, the Feast
   of Lights is a citywide party in which members of all walks of life
   join in drunken revelry and, yes, even orgies.

High Chasaline-  High Chasaline falls on the twelfth day of Taisham and
   is also known as "the Day of Reflection".  This is a day of dancing
   and reflection upon your good fortune, and complaining about
   anything is strictly frowned upon.

Chansein-  The third day of Jumara, Chansein is a day of indulgence
   in which people roam the streets handing out food to everyone they
   see... it is considered bad form to neglect to eat every bit of it.
   Chansein is celebrated throughout the Borderlands and in Arad Doman.

Feast of Abram-  The Feast of Abram falls on the ninth day of Jumara
   and is celebrated in Altara, Amadicia, Andor, Cairhien, Ghealdan,
   Illian, Murandy, Tarabon, and Tear.

Lamma Sor-  A day of remembrance for those who've fell defending the
   Borderlands, Lamma Sor is observed the day after the first quarter
   moon.  Nothing is eaten but bread, water, salt, and oil.  Lamma Sor
   is also known as the Day of Remembrance.

The Feast of Fools-  During the Feast of Fools, commoners assume the
   roles of their superiors, and their superiors carry out the tasks
   normally accomplished by their underlings.  The Feast is celebrated
   during Tammaz in Arad Doman and the Borderlands, and during Saven
   everywhere else.

Winternight-  Winternight is the night before Bel Tine, and is spent
   visiting friends and exchanging small gifts.

Bel Tine-  Celebrating the end of winter, Bel Tine is a celebration
   whose date is determined locally based upon the signs of a new
   spring.

Mabriam's Day-  On the eighteenth of Tammaz, nobody does any work,
   and it is common for young girls to play practical jokes on young
   men whom they favor... of course, if the young man happens to guess
   which girl pulled the prank on him, he gets a kiss from here as a
   reward.

Tandar-  Held on the ninth day of Maighdal, nobody is supposed to let
   the day end still holding a grudge against someone else.

Low Chasaline-  A day of fasting held on the eighteenth of Maighdal.

The Festival of Lanterns-  On the first day of Choren, brightly-
   colored paper lanterns are lit and hung everywhere.  The Festival
   is held throughout Arad Doman, Tarabon, Amadicia, Ghealdan, Altara,
   Murandy, and Illian.

Bel Arvina-  A feast held on the first day of autumn.

Amaetheon-  Held on the sixth day of Shaldine, Amaetheon is a feast
   held everywhere (except the Borderlands) in which the dead are
   remembered in a joyous celebration.

Shaoman-  On this twelfth day of Shaldine, children are praised and
   given gifts.  Going from house to house, small children sing songs
   and are rewarded with small gifts and treats.

Sunday-  A feastday and celebration held at midsummer.

-1 CAVALRY~
In most military commands, the cavalry is often the most feared unit. 
Made up of soldiers mounted upon well-trained steeds, the cavalry is quick
and deadly.  Often companies are deployed in order to help secure an area or
provide a quick strike against an enemies' weakest fortified area.  The
lightning speed of the cavarly is their greatest asset.  Players who chose
this battle group will gain the following skills (upon level requirements): 
 
[1 ] sword
[2 ] polearm
[3 ] third attack
[4 ] fourth attack
[5 ] parry
[6 ] shield block
[7 ] hedge *
[8 ] enhanced damage
[9 ] mounted combat *
[10] rear *
 
* This skill has yet to be implemented.

0 TREESINGING~
Syntax: treesing commands - lists the commands used in the treesinging editor.
Syntax: treesing show - lists the object's sung attributes.
Syntax: treesing name <name name2> - sets the object's keywords/identifiers.
Syntax: treesing type <treasure|furniture|armor|weapon> - choses object type.
Syntax: treesing short <description> - sets the object's inventory/short desc.
Syntax: treesing long <description> - sets the object's room/long desc.
Syntax: treesing form - when the object has been decided, the treesong begins.  Wait a few minutes for your work to be created!

Treesinging is the ability of gifted Ogier to infuse a certain life
within plants with their song, causing the plants to form in desired
formations.  These songs could also encourage a plant to grow stronger and
taller.  Objects created by the treesong cause no damage to the parent
plant, they are simply budded free.  

For an Ogier to use the Treesinging gift, it is required they reach a
certain maturity within the Wansho guild.  The Ogier must also be in a room
with the sector 'forest', 'field' or 'hills'.  
Those who create with the talent will have an easier time using the skill.
