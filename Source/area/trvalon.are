This man looks to be in his middle years, with a weathered complexion

fortune.

anything.

timeless looks.  The only difference in her looks from other Sedai, is that
her hair has turned grey recently, for there are still a few dark-brown
strands remaining.  She lays her hands on the wounded students, and then
sends them back to their training with her Warder.

students are mostly young men that cannot train in the Tower Yard because of
their age.  This old man has served his Sedai as her Gaidin for many years,
and now that they both have retired from their duties to the Tower, they
still want to be useful.

them, remorsing the loss of a cherished and loved belonging.  A few of the
items he sells are penned by his own hand.

the old tongue for "Brother to Battle"- a very astute description of a
Warder.  He moves about with the agile grace of a cat, the purpose of a
shark in bloodfrenzy, every step thought out, and every turn balanced for
anything.  His color-shifting cloak gives him an outline that is queasy to

The Captain of the Towerguard is here checking up on his officers.

This man is tall, with thick forearms that show a life of dedication to
the sword, and years of experience in battle.  With just a touch of gray in
his dark brown hair, the Captain of the Towerguard has many years left in
command before he will seek retirement and a pension.  He walks with a
slight swagger, as most military men do, but the sword at his side moves
with him in a manner that must only come from a lifetime at his side.  He
talks to his men while keeping them and himself at ease, having earned his
respect, while also giving it.  His men are more than just soldiers or
guards, they are Towerguard, and live a life dedicated to the preservation
of the Tower and all that it stands for.  With such a dedication to duty
among his men, the Captain spends most of his days checking in on them, and
just generally giving praise where deserved.

sword carried over each shoulder, and it is known that Arafellins are more

a pale complexion, and his hair is in two long braids with a small bell at
the end of each braid.  He slowly makes his way through the crowd towards
the Tower grounds, where he has to carry a message from the borderlands.

sword~
This sword was a gift from the Amyrlin Seat to the Captain of the
Towerguard for his years of service, awarding his honor and duty with the
finest sword any smith in Tar Valon could forge.  Emblazoned with the Flame
of Tar Valon etched continuously over the blade, hilt and pommel, this sword
is remarkable.  Its balance can be felt immediately upon handling it, but a
light touch to the blade brings back a finger wet with blood, as the blade
has been sharpened and honed to that of a razor and forged so to keep that
edge.  While not a weapon created with the Onepower, or enhanced by it, this
weapon is still the finest to be had.

map~
This map is intended to help initiate newcomers to the city of Tar Valon.
Tar Valon itself is a large island-city.  There is a harbor located at the
northern tip, and southern tip, called Northharbor and Southharbor respectively.
At the center of the island is the White Tower, and the Tower grounds, which is
surrounded by a large wall to seperate these grounds from the rest of the city.
The entrance into these grounds is called Tarloman's gate.
(The area north of Tarloman's Gate is the Tower grounds, and is a guild area,
which means that all actions there are 100% IC all of the time.)
There is a boulevard that follows along the outside of the wall surrounding 
the Tower grounds.  Several shops and businesses are located along this
boulevard.  Then, this boulevard leads away from the Tower in both the
north and south directions, leading towards the respective harbors.
Along these boulevards before they reach the harbors, are large merchant's squares
which also have several shops located nearby.  The squares also intersect with
other avenues that lead out of the city.
 
The island of Tar Valon is surrounded by six villages that lie next to the
bridges that cross the River Erinin into Tar Valon.  Three villages are on each
side, east and west.  On the west, from south to north they are :  Alindaer, 
Darein and Jualdhe.  On the east, from south to north they are:  Osenrein, 
Daghain and Luagde.  Each village is connected to Tar Valon by a beautiful
Ogier-built bridge, and each entrance to the city opens to an avenue that leads 
further into the heart of the city.
 
The Ogier originally built Tar Valon, but later, men tried to duplicate their work
as best that they could when the city was expanded.  (The current Tar Valon
is Phase I, and is mostly just the Ogier-built sections.)  Here is a few examples of
what attractions and shops can be found around Tar Valon:
 
Attractions along the boulevard surrounding the Tower grounds:
Several shops that include, a jeweller, seamstress, tailor, cobbler, leatherworker,
weaponsmith, armorsmith, fletcher, herbalist, pottery and a shop of rare nad unusual goods.
There are also a few other points of interest such as the Shining Walls Inn, the money
lender, a bookstore, and a semi-retired Gaidin who teaches, along with his
Aes Sedai of the Yellow Ajah who heals.
Just to the east on Daghain Avenue is a horse seller, whlie to the west on Darein 
Avenue is a small pet store.
There are weapon and armor shops located at both the north and south merchant
squares.  Near both the north and south harbors can be found supply stores,
tattoo parlors, and barracks for the Towerguard. Near the south merchant's square
on Alindaer Avenue is a Gilder, while far east on Osenrein Avenue is the famed
Ogier grove.  Near the north merchant's square is the local orphanage, located on
Luagde Avenue.  Near Southharbor on the South Boulevard is a local tavern called 
The Tremalking Spice that sits on a small sidestreet along the boulevard.
 
All through the city are small gardens and parks for visitors to rest, please
feel free to use them to relax and rest.
 
Much will be added to Tar Valon in the future such as the villages and filling
in the areas between the main avenues, along with several towers and homes.
For now, enjoy and look for the updates.

Sculptures of Ogier craftsmanship seamlessly rise from their white marble
platforms, surrounding this large pool that dominates the square before
Tarloman's Gate.  The works look ready to come to life, though they stand
silent and watching over the magnificent square.  A wave, seemingly caught
as the tide caresses the shore, spills water gently into the beautiful pool.
Statues of women in long robes watch over the courtyard and fountain, with a
single statue dominating the rest before the gate.  The large statue is that
of a robed woman wearing a long stole, her hands and arms wide in ceremonial
welcome.  Surrounding the pool, set apart every twenty feet, are a dozen or
so smaller fountains.  The smaller fountains also rise from the large white
marble of the square and empty into the magnificent pool through thin
rivulets between the flagstones.

The Public Square Before Tarloman's Gate~
Tarloman's Gate looms to the north, providing the public entrance through
the Shining Walls and into the grounds of the White Tower.  The White Tower
rises far above the walls, and the steps that lead into the Tower itself can
be seen through the gate.  The Shining Walls sparkle nearly as bright as the
White Tower itself, and rise high above the street as the walls continue on
to the east and to the west.  The street here is paved in large flagstones
that provide a level footing for the many visitors who are passing by the
gate and those who pass through it.

North Tar Valon Boulevard~
This wide boulevard is used for merchants to transport goods from the
North Harbor directly to the Tower grounds, and to the other several shops
and stores near the center of the city.  Along the boulevard, several
amazing towers rise from the ground in various spiraled, fluted and flared
designs.  Several of the towers have bridges that span the heights between
them and other towers, creating an incredible site as the gleaming white
bridges catch the light and glimmer brightly.  To the south rises the
tallest and most beautiful of all the towers of Tar Valon, the White Tower. 
Here the street is paved in large flagstones that provide a level footing
for the many visitors who travel this boulevard.

The Road Above North Harbor~
Here the city changes from an aesthetic design to a more practical one. 
The road is paved in flagstone, but not as large or even the same polished
stone as used on the main boulevards and avenues of Tar Valon.  This road
offers a visible seperation from the harbor area and the city.  To the north
of the road, several roofs of warehouses and the long roof covering the
wharf can be seen.  The beauty and splendor of the city of Tar Valon fills
the skyline to the south.  The road continues to the east and to the west.

This tower is sparse and functional.  Built from the same silver-streaked
white stone as the rest of Tar Valon, the walls reflect even the smallest
light into brightness.  The arrowslits and lanterns set into the walls
provide plenty of light either day or night.  The view through an arrowslit
to the north overlooks the roofs down in the wharf of North Harbor.  The
view through an arrowslit to the west overlooks the section of the River
Erinin known as the Alindrelle Erinin.  A set of narrow stone steps lead
higher up into the guard tower.  The heavy oak door to the east leads back

brightly in the sunlight, and seem almost luminous in the night, reflecting
even the faintest light.  Below, to the west, is the section of the River

be luminescent even at night, reflecting even the smallest light with a
shining glow.  There is enough room for two people to walk side by side
along the top of the wall here.  The walls come up just above waist high on
each side of the walkway.  There is a wondrous view here of the city, with
all of its towers seeming to grow out from the city itself, and the White
Tower the most beautiful of all.  Visible to the west, across the section of
the River Erinin known as the Alindrelle Erinin, is the village of Jualdhe,
and the bridge that connects it with the gate below.  The heavy oak doors to

Atop the West City Wall~
This is the walkway atop the beautiful long wall that protects the west
shore of the island of Tar Valon from north to south.  Built from the same
silver-streaked white stone as the rest of Tar Valon, the walls shine
brightly in the sunlight, and seem almost luminous in the night, reflecting
even the faintest light.  Below, to the west, is the section of the River
Erinin known as the Alindrelle Erinin.  Also visible to the west is the
village of Jualdhe on the opposite bank of the river.  To the east is the
city of Tar Valon, with all of its wondrous towers and bridges spanning the
heights.  The wall continues on to the east and to the south.

This is the upper level of the gate tower.  The few furnishings are
sparse and functional.  Built from the same silver-streaked white stone as
the rest of Tar Valon, the walls reflect even the smallest light into
brightness.  Arrowslits and lanterns provide plenty of light either day or
night.  The wonderful view through an arrowslit to the west overlooks the
section of the River Erinin known as the Alindrelle Erinin.  Also visible to
the west is the village of Darein, and the bridge that connects it with the
gate below.  A set of narrow stone steps lead deeper down into the guard
tower.  The heavy oak doors to the north and to the south lead back outside
atop the city wall.

Above the Darein Gate~
This is a section of the city wall that is above the Darein Gate and
between the guard towers to the north and to the south.  Built from the same
silver-streaked white stone as the rest of Tar Valon, the city walls seem to
be luminescent even at night, reflecting even the smallest light with a
shining glow.  There is enough room for two people to walk side by side
along the top of the wall here.  The walls come up just above waist high on
each side of the walkway.  There is a wondrous view here of Tar Valon, with
all of its towers seeming to grow out from the city itself, and the White
Tower the most beautiful of all.  Visible to the west, across the section of
the River Erinin known as the Alindrelle Erinin, is the village of Darein
and the bridge that connects it with the gate below.  The heavy oak doors to
the north and to the south enter back into the guard towers.

Here the huge bronze-clad and studded gates stand open.  The gate is wide
enough for twenty men to stand abreast of each other when it is parted.  The
bridge to the village of Darein spans to the west, across the section of the
River Erinin known as the Alindrelle Erinin.  The bridge itself is a work
worthy of this beautiful city, being worked of stone with the intricacey of
patterned lacework.  To the east, the beautiful city of Tar Valon awaits,
with broad criss-crossing avenues, fountains and amazing towers of every
shape and size.  The heavy oak doors to the north and to the south lead into
the guard towers.

Intersection of Darein Avenue and West Teardrop Way~
This is the most beautiful city in the world, and no man or woman who has
ever been here in Tar Valon could deny it.  The most amazing towers rise
from the ground in various spiraled, fluted and flared designs, and every
tower is crafted from the whitest stone known to man or Ogier.  Several of
the towers have bridges that span the heights between them and other towers,
creating an incredible site as the gleaming white bridges catch the light
and glimmer brightly.  To the east rises the tallest and most beautiful of
all the towers of Tar Valon, the White Tower.  Here the street is paved in
large white marble flagstones that provide a level footing for the many
visitors who travel this avenue.  Many small parks can be seen along the
avenue, as well as a few gardens.  The Darein Gate is to the west, leading
out of the city to the bridge that crosses the River Erinin.

South Tar Valon Boulevard~
Here the boulevard meets the entrance to the Southharbor wharf.  This
wide boulevard is used for merchants to transport goods from the Southharbor
directly to the Tower grounds, and to the other several shops and stores
near the center of the city.  Along the boulevard, several amazing towers
rise from the ground in various spiraled, fluted and flared designs. 
Several of the towers have bridges that span the heights between them and
other towers, creating an incredible site as the gleaming white bridges
catch the light and glimmer brightly.  To the north rises the tallest and
most beautiful of all the towers of Tar Valon, the White Tower.  Here the
street is paved in large white marble flagstones that provide a level
footing for the many visitors who travel this boulevard.  A beautiful
redstone arch is here above the top of the stairs that lead down into the
wharf.  A road leads to the east and west and divides the city from the edge
of the wharf and harbor area.

Here the city changes from an aesthetic design to a more practical one. 
The road is paved in flagstone, but not as large or even the same type of
stone used on the main boulevards and avenues of Tar Valon.  This road
offers a visible seperation from the harbor area and the city.  To the south
of the road, several roofs of warehouses and the long roof covering the
wharf can be seen.  The beauty and splendor of the city of Tar Valon fills
the skyline to the north.  The road continues to the east and to the west.

There is a shop to the north, with small statues of mighty sailors and
whimsical nymphs set in niches along the side of the building.  Unlike the
bustle of traffic that echoes from the wharf below, there seems to be no one
going in or out of the northern building.

building is to the north, with members of the city guard entering and

architecture to the north, set in niches along this building are well
sculptured statues of valiant guardsmen wearing the favour of Tar Valon.

road, several roofs of warehouses and the long roof covering the wharf can
be seen.  The beauty and splendor of the city of Tar Valon fills the skyline
to the north.  The road continues to the east and to the west.

West Southharbor Lane~
Here the city changes from an aesthetic design to a more practical one. 
The road is paved in flagstone, but not as large or even of the same type as
used on the main boulevards and avenues of Tar Valon.  This road offers a
visible seperation from the harbor area and the city.  To the south of the
road, several roofs of warehouses and the long roof covering the wharf can
be seen.  The beauty and splendor of the city of Tar Valon fills the skyline
to the north.  The road continues to the east and to the west.  Several
guardsmen and clean-cut sailors come and go from the shop to the north.

South Harbor Guard Tower~
This tower is sparse and functional.  Built from the same silver-streaked
white stone as the rest of Tar Valon, the walls reflect even the smallest
light into brightness.  The arrowslits and lanterns provide plenty of light
either day or night.  The view through an arrowslit to the south overlooks
the roofs down in the wharf of South Harbor.  The view through an arrowslit
to the west overlooks the section of the River Erinin known as the
Alindrelle Erinin.  A set of narrow stone steps lead higher up into the
guard tower.  The heavy oak door to the east leads back outside.

South Harbor Guard Tower~
Here in the highest part of the guard tower, there are only sparse
furnishings meant for pure functionality.  Built from the same
silver-streaked white stone as the rest of Tar Valon, the walls reflect even
the smallest light into brightness.  The arrowslits and lanterns set into
the walls provide plenty of light either day or night.  The view through an
arrowslit to the south overlooks the roofs down in the wharf of South
Harbor, and a few of the ships and boats in the beautiful Ogier-built basin.
The view through an arrowslit to the west overlooks the section of the River
Erinin known as the Alindrelle Erinin.  A set of narrow stone steps lead
down deeper into the guard tower.  The heavy oak door to the north leads out
atop the long wall that runs the length of the island.

This is the walkway atop the beautiful long wall that protects the west
shore of the island of Tar Valon from north to south.  Built from the same
silver-streaked white stone as the rest of Tar Valon, the walls shine
brightly in the sunlight, and seem almost luminous in the night, reflecting
even the faintest light.  Below, to the west, is the section of the River
Erinin known as the Alindrelle Erinin.  Also visible to the west is the
village of Alindaer on the opposite bank of the river.  To the east is the

along the top of the wall here.  The walls come up just above waist high on
each side of the walkway.  There is a wondrous view here of the city, with
all of its towers seeming to grow out from the city itself, and the White
Tower the most beautiful of all.  Visible to the west, across the section of
the River Erinin known as the Alindrelle Erinin, is the village of Alindaer

Atop the West City Wall~
This is the walkway atop the beautiful long wall that protects the west
shore of the island of Tar Valon from north to south.  Built from the same
silver-streaked white stone as the rest of Tar Valon, the walls shine
brightly in the sunlight, and seem almost luminous in the night, reflecting
even the faintest light.  Below, to the west, is the section of the River
Erinin known as the Alindrelle Erinin.  Also visible to the west is the
village of Darein on the opposite bank of the river.  To the east is the
city of Tar Valon, with all of its wondrous towers and bridges spanning the
heights.  The wall continues on to the west and to the south.

The Top of the Southharbor Steps~
Here atop the steps that lead down into Southharbor there is a fine view
of the Ogier-built basin.  Surrounded by the white walls that almost
completely encircle the basin, the wide gates stand open to the south to
allow vessels access to the harbor.  Dozens of dockworkers can be seen
unloading and loading cargo from ships all along the wharf.  The majority of
the wharf has a long roof to cover it.  There are also a few warehouses
along the wharf for storing the merchants' goods, though none rise higher
than four stories.  The streets of Southharbor are of tightly-paved
cobblestone, in contrast with the rest of the city.  Unlike the beautiful
white marble bridges that cross Tar Valon, wooden bridges cross between the
buildings and wharf of Southharbor giving it a more practical air than the
fancy of the city.  From the bridges and various beams that cross the docks,
lanterns hang allowing the dockmen to work both day and night.

The Bottom of the Southharbor Steps~
All along the harbor dockworkers, cargo handlers, sailors and merchants
go about their duties in a hurried pace, wasting no time as they load and
unload their cargo.  The noise of the wharf is a little overwhelming here. 
The harbor arcs around each side to nearly meet at its southern tip, where
the harbor gates stand open.  The steps here lead up out of the harbor and
into the city.

Many dockworkers and sailors move about the wharf, transfering goods to and

from merchants shouting orders to the dockworkers.  To the east and west the
wharf curves around towards the harbor entrance to the south.  The steps to
the north lead up, out of the harbor, and into the city of Tar Valon. 
Unlike the rest of the city of Tar Valon, it is not stone bridges but wooden
onbes that cross the buildings and wharf of Southharbor.  The normal
flagstone of the city has also been replaced by tightly-paved cobblestone,
which shows no less wear than the white marble of the northern glory.

the roof up.  Several crates and chests are stacked all about the warehouse.

The North Harbor Wharf~
Here at the edge of the wharf the water laps gently against the seawall. 
There is quite a bit of noise here due to the merchants shouting orders to
the dockworkers.  Many sailors and dockworkers busily move cargo between the
warehouses and ships.  One of the many warehouses that line the wharf is to
the south.  To the east and west the wharf curves around towards the harbor
entrance to the north.  Several ships and boats are moored by their stern
all along the wharf.

Alindaer Gate Guard Tower~
This is the ground level of the gate tower.  The few furnishings here are
sparse and functional.  Built from the same silver-streaked white stone as
the rest of Tar Valon, the walls reflect even the smallest light into
brightness.  Arrowslits and lanterns set in the walls provide plenty of
light either day or night.  The view through an arrowslit to the west

silver-streaked white stone as the rest of Tar Valon, the walls shine
brightly in the sunlight, and seem almost luminous in the night, reflecting
even the faintest light.  Below, to the east, is the section of the River
Erinin known as the Osendrelle Erinin.  Also visible to the east is the
village of Luagde on the opposite bank of the river.  To the west is the

This is the upper level of the gate tower.  The few furnishings are
sparse and functional.  Built from the same silver-streaked white stone as

all of its towers seeming to grow out from the city itself, and the White

Tower the most beautiful of all.  Visible to the east, across the section of
the River Erinin known as the Osendrelle Erinin, is the village of Daghain,
and the bridge that connects it with the gate below.  The heavy oak doors to
the north and to the south enter back into the guard towers.

Daghain Gate Guard Tower~
This is the ground level of the gate tower.  The few furnishings here are
sparse and functional.  Built from the same silver-streaked white stone as
the rest of Tar Valon, the walls reflect even the smallest light into
brightness.  Arrowslits and lanterns set in the walls provide plenty of
light either day or night.  The view through an arrowslit to the east
overlooks the section of the River Erinin known as the Osendrelle Erinin.  A
set of narrow stone steps lead higher up into the guard tower.  The heavy
oak door to the south leads back outside.

Through Daghain Gate~
Here the huge bronze-clad and studded gates stand open.  The gate is wide
enough for twenty men to stand abreast of each other when it is parted.  The
bridge to the village of Daghain spans to the east, across the section of
the River Erinin known as the Osendrelle Erinin.  To the west, the beautiful
city of Tar Valon awaits, with broad criss-crossing avenues, fountains and
amazing towers of every shape and size.  The heavy oak doors to the north
and to the south lead into the guard towers.

Intersection of Daghain Avenue and East Teardrop Way~
This is the most beautiful city in the world, and no man or woman who has
ever been here in Tar Valon could deny it.  The most amazing towers rise
from the ground in various spiraled, fluted and flared designs, and every
tower is crafted in the whitest stone known to man or Ogier.  Several of the
towers have bridges that span the heights between them and other towers,
creating an incredible site as the gleaming white bridges catch the light
and glimmer brightly.  To the west rises the tallest and most beautiful of
all the towers of Tar Valon, the White Tower.  Here the street is paved in
large flagstones that provide a level footing for the many visitors who
travel this avenue.  Many small parks can be seen along the avenue, as well
as a few gardens.  The Daghain Gate is to the east, leading out of the city
to the bridge that crosses the River Erinin.

Osenrein Gate Guard Tower~
This is the upper level of the gate tower.  The few furnishings are
sparse and functional.  Built from the same silver-streaked white stone as
the rest of Tar Valon, the walls reflect even the smallest light into
brightness.  Arrowslits and lanterns set in the walls provide plenty of
light either day or night.  The wonderful view through an arrowslit to the
east overlooks the section of the River Erinin known as the Osendrelle
Erinin.  Also visible to the east is the village of Osenrein, and the bridge
that connects it with the gate below.  A set of narrow stone steps lead
deeper down into the guard tower.  The heavy oak doors to the north and to
the south lead back outside atop the city wall.

Above the Osenrein Gate~
This is a section of the city wall that is above the Osenrein Gate, and
between the guard towers to the north and to the south.  Built from the same
silver-streaked white stone as the rest of Tar Valon, the city walls seem to
be luminescent even at night, reflecting even the smallest light with a
shining glow.  There is enough room for two people to walk side by side
along the top of the wall here.  The walls come up just above waist high on
each side of the walkway.  There is a wondrous view here of the city, with
all of its towers seeming to grow out from the city itself, and the White
Tower the most beautiful of all.  Visible to the east, across the section of
the River Erinin known as the Osendrelle Erinin, is the village of Osenrein.
and the bridge that connects it with the gate below.  The heavy oak doors to

Through the Osenrein Gate~
Here the huge bronze-clad and studded gates stand open.  The gate is wide
enough for twenty men to stand abreast of each other when it is parted.  The
bridge to the village of Osenrein spans to the east, across the section of
the River Erinin known as the Osendrelle Erinin.  To the west, the beautiful
city of Tar Valon awaits, with broad criss-crossing avenues, fountains and
amazing towers of every shape and size.  The heavy oak doors to the north
and to the south lead into the guard towers.

South Harbor Guard Tower~
Here in the highest part of the guard tower, there are only sparse
furnishings meant solely for their functionality.  Built from the same
silver-streaked white stone as the rest of Tar Valon, the walls reflect even
the smallest light into brightness.  The arrowslits and lanterns set in the
walls provide plenty of light either day or night.  The view through an
arrowslit to the south overlooks the roofs down in the wharf of South Harbor
and a few of the ships and boats in the beautiful Ogier-built basin.  The
view through an arrowslit to the east overlooks the section of the River
Erinin known as the Osendrelle Erinin.  A set of narrow stone steps lead
downwards deeper into the guard tower.  The heavy oak door to the north
leads out atop the long wall that runs the length of the island.

that span the heights to connect the towers.  Here the street is paved in
large white marble flagstones that provide a level footing for the many
visitors who travel this way.  Many small parks can be seen along the way,
as well as a few gardens.  The avenue continues on towards the White Tower

Above the River Erinin on the Luagde Bridge~
This beautiful bridge connects the village of Luagde to the east with the
city of Tar Valon to the west.  The openwork waist-high walls of the bridge
are as detailed and as beautiful as any lacework imaginable.  The city walls
of Tar Valon dominate the view to the west.  Overwhelming and breath-taking,
the high walls and the towers that interrupt the walls at intervals are made
from the same gleaming white, silver-streaked stone that most of Tar Valon
is built from.  The bridge arches towards Luagde to the east and connects
seamlessly with the city walls of Tar Valon to the west.  Far below, the
section of the River Erinin known as the Osendrelle Erinin flows past
unhindered as the bridge spans from shore to shore with no supports in
between.

Entrance to the Ogier Grove~
This is the entrance into the ogier grove, an opening in the unusual wall
that surrounds it.  The wall is actually an endless series of spiraling
stone arches, five spans high and twice as wide.  Through the spaces in
between the arches, people can be seen bustling along the street outside the
wall.  While not as wild as a forest nor as tame as a park, this grove seems
a delicate ideal between the two in its own natural growth and beauty.  To
the south, the Great Trees dwarf all below them.  A small gate to the north
leads back out to the street.

The Ogier Grove in Tar Valon~
Here in the grove, the Great Trees dwarf all below them.  The many elm,
oak, leatherleaf and fir trees seem small beneath the canopy of even one
Great Tree.  While not as wild as a forest nor as tame as a park, this grove
seems a delicate ideal between the two in its own natural growth and beauty.
All surroundings quickly become similar and sight is limited by the thick
foliage of the grove.  Only trees and undergrowth are visible in every
direction.

in both value and beauty.  The shop owner cautiously watches all of his
customers and treasures, making sure not a single one goes unsupervised. 
With all of the gold, silver, and precious gems here, the shop owner should
probably hire a guard for protection.  No doubt he must feel safe having his
shop this close to the White Tower.

This room is very large and very well-lit.  The floor is multi-level, and
padded in some places.  Where the floor is not padded, the hardwood planks
have been swept clean.  The floor rises and falls, creating various levels
for the students to train from, learning different tactics for each stance
required.  A few wooden practice weapons have been set in corners, but most
of them have been put away in the large rack against one wall.  The old
Warder patiently instructs his students in tactics, strategies and physical
training.  To the west is the infirmary for the students who require rest or
more serious attention to their wounds.  (Type 'gain list' or 'practice' for
a listing of what the old Warder teaches, type 'gain practice' to gain more
practice time or 'gain convert' to gain more training time).

money lender totals up how many are in each pile before puttings the coins
in locked boxes.  Set atop the counter are other devices as well, such as
scales and weights, all used to discern an honest man's coin from that of a
rogue's.  The money lender of Tar Valon is a thrifty man, seeing all the
guile that robs other merchants from a few shaved coins here and a few
shaved coins there.

towers.  The very comfortable-looking bed completes the cozy feel of this

Main Room of a Small Orphanage~
This large home was donated to the city years ago and qas quickly
renovated as an orphanage for the urchin children of Tar Valon and the
surrounding countryside.  This room serves as a waiting area, where vistors
can be greeted and the children can gather.  The room is kept clean and
there are very few furnishings.  Through the door to the north, the bustle
of Tar Valon intrudes on the orphanage, while children can be heard giggling
through the door east.  A hallway exits the waiting room south and the
dining area lies west.

A Small Study~
This room serves as a study for the children, but due to limited funds
there are no desks for the children and they must do their writing and
reading on the floor.  Very few books are available to the children, and
most of them are tattered and worn.  A few small windows overlook the street
and the many people making their way by and occasionally looking in the
window at the children.  The door to the west leads back to the main room of

Piles of half-destroyed toys are pushed into each corner to make enough

into a place like this.  Ink has been dripped on the floor, mixed with blood
and other bodily fluids of unknown origin.  Several needles are strewn about
the room, most of them in rubbish piles, or casually set down in filth. 
Many of the small inkpots used for the tattoos have a covering of a slimy
mold on top of the ink.  A person should remember that all tattoos are
PERMANENT before coming to such an establishment.

The Infirmary~
This room serves as an infirmary for the students.  Sometimes those who
come to learn over-exert themselves or become wounded in a fierce spar. 
Very rarely, a student becomes injured enough to require the Aes Sedai's
healing touch, but if needed, she is here to help (after a small donation
that goes to the city orphanage).  The room is well-lit, and smells lightly
of rose petals.  The sounds of clashing weapons come from the training room
to the east.  (Type 'heal' for a full listing of the Aes Sedai's services).

Suprisingly enough would this shop be one that sells pets.  The white

captured forever in stone.  The scene is one of nature's joy.  Set about
this shop are a few dozen cages, each holding different types of pets from
kittens and puppies to large hunting hounds.  The echoes of the animals ring
throughout the shop, louder than the keeper or the bell hanging from the
door, as if they sense another family is about to bring them a new home.

nor the wild of an untamed forest.  The stout iron fence is lost in the
trees to the left and right, curving as it stretches around this section of
the grove.  Atop the iron fence are freshly sharpened iron spikes, looking
as if they could puncture through platemail armor without any trouble.

set the garden aglow in a wash of reds, pinks, and whites.  Many people sit
in the garden, gaining not just rest from their wanderings in the city, but
relaxation from the tranquility of the surroundings.

A School of Weapons and Tactics~
This room is very large and very well-lit.  The floor is multi-level and
padded in some places.  Where the floor is not padded, the hardwood planks
have been swept clean.  The floor rises and falls, creating various levels
for the students to train from, learning different tactics for each stance
required.  A few wooden practice weapons have been set in corners, but most
of them have been put away in the large rack against one wall.

The Tremalking Spice~
This smoke-filled tavern is called The Tremalking Spice.  Known by
sailors and other disreputable types to be one of the finest dicing taverns
north of Tear, this tavern is full of people interested in only dicing and
drinking.  A lot of dirt and debris covers the floor of the tavern.  In this
room several dice games are being played, no two alike, but in other rooms,
they play only specific games to keep things simple.

The Tremalking Spice~
This room is nearly a fog through all the tabac smoke.  A lot of men are
here dicing their wages away, most of them drinking, drunk, or passed out. 
The floor is covered in dirt, debris, food scraps, spilled ale, vomit, and
other things almost impossible to make out.  Here the men are playing a
specific dice game only, a dice game called "Maiden's Run".

A Dark Sidestreet~
This cobblestone sidestreet is twisting and very dark.  Several corners
and niches are so darkly shadowed that nothing is visible within them. 
Every window along this sidestreet is shuttered, which is very unusual for
Tar Valon.  Most of the buildings here are only a single story, and all have
a tiled roof that is near flat.  The sidestreet continues to the east and
west.

South Guard Barracks~
This building serves as a place for the guard of Tar Valon to rest and
sleep, and still be close to their post.  Since the Tower grounds lie at the
center of the city, there is a need to keep guards close by to the north and
south harbors.  This barracks has a low ceiling, barely above a grown man's
head.  Several candles are in holders along the wall, providing an ample
amount of light for the room.  This particular room of the barracks serves
as a meeting place for the guard when off duty.  The men usually play a
little dice, or tend to their weapons and equipment here.  To the east and
west are the sleeping quarters of the guard.  To the north is the sleeping
quarters for the officers.  The door to the south leads back outside.

paved in large white marble flagstones that provide a level footing for the
man visitors who travel this avenue.  The avenue continues to the northeast
