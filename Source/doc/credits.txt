	The WoT (Wheel of Time) Mud system could not be possible without
help from many others.  WoT is a deriviative of Russ Taylors ROM 2.4b4 MUD
source and as such, retains all of the copyrights and licenses of the
Original ROM 2.4, Merc and DIKU MUD distributions.  The Name "Wheel of
Time" is copyright by Robert Jordan, and TOR books.

  I would like to thank the following people for their contributions to
WoT MUD. It's folks like these, people who have written source code for
ROM and WoT and then released it into the public for all to use who have
made the Diku family of MUD's what it is today...

ROM 2.4 is copyright 1993, 1996 by Russ Taylor.  and is a deriviative
of Merc Diku Mud.

Merc Diku Mud is a derivative of the original Diku Mud and is subject to
their copyright and license agreement.  Merc Diku Mud contains substantial
enhancements to Diku Mud.  These enhancements are copyright 1992, 1993 by
Michael Chastain, Michael Quan, and Mitchell Tse.

Diku Mud is copyright (C) 1990, 1991 by Sebastian Hammer, Michael Seifert,
Hans Henrik St{rfeldt, Tom Madsen, and Katja Nyboe.  Their license
