# TheAgeOfStone
The Age Of Stone was a text based role playing game that I decided to create with some friends whilst a teenager at School. The game is based on Gary McNickle's WoTMUD Code base and is written predominately in C with a few C++ classes.

From what I can remember of the project we spent a lot of time designing the various game mechanics based on our own experiences of games at the time. This was my second C/C++ project having learned the very basics from the excellent book, "The C Programming Language" by Brian Kernighan and Dennis Ritchie.  

I had a lot of fun reading back through the various design documents and source code so feel free to have a look. I can promise lots of poorly written code, memory leaks, badly named variables, poor design and hacked together fixes to keep you entertained! Hey, you've got to start somewhere right?
